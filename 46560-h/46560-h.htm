Arch.</span></p></div>


<div class="sidenote">ONGCOR THÔM.</div>

<p>Half-a-mile beyond Bakhêng are the ruins of Ongcor-Thôm.
A partly-destroyed road, hidden by thick layers
of sand and dust, and crossing a large ditch, half filled
with blocks of stone, portions of columns, and fragments
of sculptured lions and elephants, leads to the gateway of
the town, which is built in the style of a triumphal arch.</p>

<p>These remains are in a tolerable state of preservation,
and are composed of a central tower, 18 metres high,
surrounded by four turrets, and flanked by two other
towers connected together by galleries. At the top are
four immense heads in the Egyptian style; and every
available space is filled with sculpture. At the foot of
the great tower is a passage for carriages; and on each
side of it are doors and staircases communicating with the
walls, the whole building being constructed of sandstone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
The outer wall is composed of blocks of ferruginous stone,
and extends right and left from the entrance. It is about
24 miles square, 3 met. 80 centimet. thick, and 7 met.
high, and serves as a support to a glacis which rises
almost from the top. At the four cardinal points are
doors, there being two on the east side. Within this vast
enclosure, now covered with an almost impenetrable
forest, are a vast number of buildings, more or less in
ruin, which testify to the ancient splendour of the town.
In some places, where the heavy rains have washed away
the soil, or where the natives have dug in search for
treasure, may be seen immense quantities of porcelain and
pottery.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prea sat Ling poun.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">PREA SAT LING POUN.</div>

<p>Within the enclosure of Ongcor Thôm, and two miles
from the west gate, are to be seen through the trees the
tops of the high towers of a building called by the Cambodians
“Prea sat Ling poun,” that is to say, “The Pagoda
where they play hide and seek.” It is a collection of 37
towers of unequal size, connected by galleries which cross
each other perpetually, and form a labyrinth through
which it is not easy to find one’s way. A long shallow
ditch, crossed by four roads leading to the principal
entrances, surrounds it on all sides. Beyond the ditch
rises the wall of a gallery, of which the exterior colonnades
and the roof are only a mass of ruins, over which
you must climb to reach the interior. This wall is still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
intact: it is about 120 metres long, and forms a square
round the pagoda. About 1 metre from the ground are
visible, in places where the blocks fallen from the roof
have not hidden everything, various bas-reliefs carved in
the thickness of the wall: they are not surmounted by
cornices as at Ongcor-Wat, by which it would seem as
if they had never been finished.</p>

<p>Besides the four principal entrances there were other
doors at unequal distances in this gallery, but singularly
enough many of them have been walled up. The gallery
was connected with the main body of the building by
four smaller ones opposite each of the great doors, and
forming a covered way to the interior; but all these
galleries are destroyed.</p>

<p>The second enclosure is 65 metres square, and each
front is composed of five towers, connected by galleries.
The central and corner towers are the largest: they are
about 13 metres high. High galleries connect the centre
tower with the intermediate ones, which again are connected
with those at the corners by galleries of a less
elevation.</p>

<p>On each side are seven staircases, of six steps each,
and leading either to towers or galleries: these galleries
are covered by a triple roof: a central one 7 metres high,
resting on an outer wall, and on columns 2 metres in
height; an exterior roof on a double row of columns; and
a third resting on a very low wall, pierced with numerous
large windows looking on to a narrow interior court.</p>

<p>On the exterior of the wall, which on one side sustains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the high roof, are a series of bas-reliefs, surrounding the
whole gallery. They are sculptured in the thickness of
the wall, and are curious from the scenes and costumes
they represent. These scenes are drawn more from the
sacred books of the people than from their history; for
men with ten heads and twenty arms, fantastic animals,
griffins and dragons, are favourite subjects. The men all
wear the langouti, and often nothing beside, and have the
ears pierced and hanging on their shoulders: many have
long beards.</p>

<p>In the vestibules of the towers, and in the high galleries
near them, are kings and queens seated on a rich dais,
with a numerous court, and surrounded by persons carrying
parasols, fans, standards, and caskets: there are likewise
many musicians with drums, flutes, and harps.</p>

<p>In the galleries are represented several boats’ crews
fighting; while underneath are fishes disputing for the
bodies of the slain. There are also in the same galleries
persons in attitudes of adoration, with clasped hands,
before a figure of Samonakodom.</p>

<p>In another part is a long procession: the king is in a
large open carriage, divided into three compartments, he
being in the centre one, and his wives in the two others.
This carriage has six wheels and two shafts, which rest on
the shoulders of eight men. The chiefs are mounted on
elephants or horses, or seated in carriages drawn by four
led horses, and by their side march a numerous company
bearing standards, parasols, and caskets.</p>

<p>The bas-reliefs at the east and north sides represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
similar scenes, as well as many of the fabulous men and
animals which are to be seen in those at Ongcor-Wat.
In numerous places the water, trickling through holes in
the roof, has so obliterated the carving that the subjects
can no longer be recognised. This gallery, with its sixteen
towers, is connected with another only 3 metres distant;
and this last has five towers on each side, of which the
three in the middle face the exterior towers. The interior
of the gallery with its three roofs receives no light but
by the doors, and is so dark that torches are necessary
when it is visited. The gallery, sustained by two rows of
columns and by an exterior wall, has no bas-reliefs. The
towers, which are built at equal distances, are thus disposed:
the largest at the angles, two smaller ones next to
them, and one of medium size in the centre.</p>

<p>The middle of the terrace is occupied by a large tower
connected with the gallery by two others, only about a
metre distant. The central tower is circular at the base,
is 20 metres in diameter, and nearly 40 metres high, and
has on each side a turret. A colonnade supporting a roof,
now in ruins, surrounds it: the columns, each of which is
hewn out of a single block of stone more than 40 metres
high, are still standing. Four doors lead to the interior.
Outside this tower, between each two doors, are three
chapels, constructed out of the thickness of the wall, and
having no communication with each other, nor with the
exterior. In nearly every one of them is a full-length
statue of Samanokodom seated on a pedestal.</p>

<p>On visiting this place you behold on every side the tops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of these numerous towers, and the roofs of the galleries,
intermingled with large trees, creepers, and thistles, which
invade the courts, the terraces, and other parts; and you
have at first some difficulty in comprehending the arrangements
of the different buildings. It is only after a long
examination that you perceive the symmetry of them as a
whole, and that these thirty-seven towers and numerous
galleries are all in regular order. Some parts are in good
preservation; others have been dealt hardly with by time,
in spite of the immense size of the blocks of stone, and
the skill with which they are united; and the condition
of this stone, ready to crumble to powder, seems to prove
that this structure was anterior to Ongcor-Wat.</p>

<p>Like it, it is built of sandstone, and the roofs are very
similar, only that, in place of the pointed stones ranged
in courses at Ongcor, these are embellished, at about
two-thirds of their height, with four gigantic sculptured
heads.</p>

<p>The roof is terminated by a very elegant embrasure,
a feature not belonging to the other temple. Every door
in the building is sunk, and many of them are admirably
carved, displaying scenes full of expression, skilfully
arranged, and exquisitely delicate in detail. They represent
various subjects: worshippers prostrated before their
idols, musicians and comedians performing pantomimes,
chariots filled with warriors standing up, and drawn by
horses galloping: in some instances they appear to be
running races.</p>

<p>Not far from this labyrinth are three platforms close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
together, each occupied by a colossal idol of stone, and
gilt. These idols appear to be of modern date; but at
their feet are assembled a number of others, some uninjured,
some broken, collected from among the ruins. On
one of the platforms are several stones fixed in the ground;
on one of which is a long undecipherable inscription.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Phiménan Aca. The Palace of the ancient Kings.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">ANCIENT PALACE.</div>

<p>Three walls at some distance from each other, and each
bounded by a moat, surround what remains of the palace
of the ancient kings. Within the first enclosure are two
towers connected by galleries, which form four sides, like
a triumphal arch. The walls are of ferruginous stone,
and the length of each block forms the thickness of the
wall. The towers and galleries are of sandstone.</p>

<p>A hundred metres from the angle of the square formed
on the north side by the wall, is a singular building, consisting
of two high terraces, and communicating with the
outer wall by another terrace half in ruins.</p>

<p>In a cavity recently made by excavations, are visible
large sculptured blocks, which seem to have fallen from
the top. The walls, still intact, are covered with bas-reliefs,
disposed in four rows, one above another, each
representing a king seated in the Oriental fashion, with
his hands resting on a broken poignard, and by his side
a number of women. All these figures are covered with
ornaments, such as very long earrings, necklaces, and
bracelets. Their costume is the langouti, and all wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
high head-dresses terminating in a point, and apparently
composed of precious stones, pearls, and gold and silver
ornaments.</p>

<p>On another side the bas-reliefs represent combats; and
here are children with long hair tied up like the savages
of the East. Everything here, however, yields in beauty
to the statue of the leprous king, which is at the end of
the terrace. The head, admirable in its nobility, regularity
of feature, and gentle yet proud expression, must
have been the work of the most skilful sculptor of the
country, in an age when many, doubtless, evinced great
talent. A small moustache covers his upper lip, and his
hair falls in long curls over his shoulders; but the whole
body is naked, and without ornament. One foot and one
hand are broken.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prea sat sour prôt.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">RUINED PAGODAS.</div>

<p>About 1200 metres in front of the building just described
is one called “Prea sat sour prôt,” and said to have been
the royal treasury. It is square, and consists of sixteen
towers connected by galleries, but nearly all in ruins: the
doorways and walls are ornamented with sculpture, as in
the other remains. It served, they say, as a depository
for the crown jewels. The Cambodians also believe that
ropes were stretched from one tower to another, on which
dancers exercised their skill in the presence of the king,
who, seated on one of the neighbouring terraces, enjoyed
their performances. All traditions being lost, the natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
invent new ones, according to the measure of their
capacity.</p>

<p>The centre of the interior of the third enclosure is
occupied by an immense esplanade, supported by walls
formed of magnificent blocks of stone, sculptured and
surrounded by staircases. The ground is level; but in
the excavations that had been made I remarked large
masses of carved stone.</p>

<p>Not far from this esplanade is a square building in
tolerable preservation, the basement composed of great
blocks of ferruginous stone, as are the staircases, of which
there are four, one on each side; but they are so steep,
narrow, and worn away that it is difficult to climb them.
The base supports small galleries, very narrow, and having
windows with carved bars. The stones and every doorway
are covered with inscriptions.</p>

<p>In the centre of the gallery rises a ruined tower,
approached by four staircases, as awkward to ascend as
the others just mentioned. Near the doors are some
figures of women, standing with flowers in their hands.
This building appears very old: the stone is crumbling
away like rotten wood.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prea sat Fiao Saïe.</span></h3>

<p>On the banks of the river which skirts the eastern side
of Ongcor Thôm are several remains. The first you come
to is Fiao Saïe, two or three hundred metres from the
water’s edge. Large and deep ditches surround it on all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
sides; and when these have been crossed you arrive in
front of a terrace 45 metres long, and 2 metres 50 centimetres
in width. Four rows of columns 1 metre high are
all that is left standing. Those in the middle rows are
square, the others are fluted, with capitals. This terrace
leads to a square formed by four galleries, each 20 metres
long: the one facing the terrace has three porticoes with
doors and staircases, while in the centre, and at each
corner of the gallery, are towers.</p>

<p>Another gallery, 40 metres long, leads from the central
tower to another larger one, where, on a high pedestal,
is placed the principal idol. On each side of this tower
are three staircases, with porticoes projecting four or five
metres, and supported by six high columns. All the
windows have been ornamented with twisted bars, many
of which still remain. By the side of each door are carved
columns, every block being cut and polished with infinite
patience and art. There are some bas-reliefs portraying a
lion devouring a stag, dances, pantomimes, worshippers
before idols, &amp;c. As at Ongcor-Wat, the building is
entirely composed of great blocks of sandstone.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prea sat Iheur Manone Tireada, or the Temple of
the Angels.</span></h3>

<p>This little pagoda is only about 150 metres from the
preceding, and, according to tradition, was formerly a
celebrated school for Buddhist theology. At the east is
the principal entrance, which consists of a gallery 18<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
metres long, with a portico in the centre, and staircases.
A second gallery, 30 metres long, terminated by a tower,
extends from the centre of the other, and at about two-thirds
of its length open out on either side porticoes and
staircases. There are two other small buildings north and
south, and a third behind the tower. That on the south
is in good preservation, but receives no light except
through a single door. This pagoda has been built with
smaller stones than the other temples: in its architecture
and details it much resembles Fiao Saïe.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Bridge.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">THE BRIDGE.</div>

<p>Near Iheur Manone Tireada is a bridge of very ancient
date, in a fair state of preservation, excepting the parapet
and a portion of the roadway, which are a mass of ruins;
but the piers and arches still remain. The piers are
formed of sandstone, some of the blocks being long, others
square, and placed irregularly; a few only are carved.</p>

<p>This bridge, with its fourteen narrow arches, may be
about 42 or 43 metres in length, and 45 metres wide.</p>

<p>The river, instead of flowing under its arches, runs now
along the side, its bed having been altered by the shifting
of the sand, which has so accumulated around the piers
and fallen stones, that a great portion of the former is
concealed.</p>

<p>This bridge must have served as a communication
between Ongcor the Great and the high road, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
traversing the province from east to west, took afterwards
a southerly direction.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prea sat Kéo.</span></h3>

<p>Two hundred metres from the bridge rise, amidst the
forest, the imposing ruins of Prea sat Kéo, to reach which
you have to cross a deep moat. This done, you arrive at
the exterior wall, which has four entrances formed by
elegant pavilions, with staircases of eight steps leading to
a terrace raised nearly 2 metres from the ground; from
this you pass into a low narrow gallery with numerous
interior windows ornamented with twisted bars. This
gallery surrounds the building, and you ascend to it by a
staircase leading to a second terrace. Three other terraces,
each more than 3 metres 50 centimetres wide, rise one
above another, supported on blocks of well-cut sandstone.</p>

<p>Each terrace forms a perfect square, the sides of the
first measuring each 30 metres in length. A staircase, 15
metres high and 3&frac12; metres wide, leads to the top; and
a wide parapet to the staircase serves as a pedestal for
four statues of lions, more or less injured. In the centre
of the upper terrace is a lofty tower, and there are four
smaller ones at the corners. Each tower has four porticoes
with staircases, which rest on a base 7 metres high, and
these towers are reached by staircases of twenty-two steps.
From them a magnificent view is obtained over the surrounding
forest. They, as well as their bases and staircases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
are built of great blocks of granite arranged in
regular tiers, and joined together in the most perfect
manner. There is little sculpture, and the doorways have
been left unfinished. The towers are without roofs, and
perhaps never had any. The whole building appears very
ancient, judging by the condition of the stone, which in
many places is falling to pieces.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pontéey ta Proum.&mdash;Town of Ta Proum.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">RUINED TOWNS.</div>

<p>On the road before mentioned are two towns containing
some remarkable buildings. These towns, each of which
is enclosed by walls forming a square, almost touch each
other, being only about 20 metres apart. The walls are
of ferruginous stone, surmounted by a coping of carved
sandstone resembling a cornice, above which are serrated
stones, giving a very finished appearance to the wall.</p>

<p>The smallest of these towns is called Pontéey Kedey
(Town of Kedey); the other, Pontéey ta Proum.</p>

<p>The town of Ta Proum has seven gateways in the style
of triumphal arches, formed by a central tower at the
entrance and by lateral galleries. As at Ongcor the
Great, a deep track is worn in the roadway beneath by
the passage of vehicles. The interior of the town is completely
deserted; no one enters it except the Cambodians
from a hamlet outside the enclosure, who cultivate a few
rice-plantations. In the centre are the ruins of a large
and splendid monument, which has suffered greatly by
the hand of time, and perhaps also from barbarous invasions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
The ruins are surrounded by a double wall of
ferruginous stone and by deep moats; and at every entrance
are galleries with porticoes. A long gallery, 120
metres on each side, and with porticoes at the middle and
at each end, goes quite round the building. Exteriorly,
on each side, are two detached towers about 10 or 15
metres from the ruins. This gallery is formed by an
interior wall and colonnades supporting a vaulted roof,
which in many places has fallen in, and most of the
columns are overthrown.</p>

<p>On the opposite wall are large bas-reliefs, forming series
of subjects, set in a magnificent framework, which is in so
good a state of preservation that the delicacy of the execution
can be appreciated. As for the bas-reliefs themselves,
they are much injured, not so much by time as by some
barbarous hand, for everywhere are marks of the hammer
or pickaxe. Leaving this gallery on the western side,
you enter a long court, in which are three detached towers,
and on the opposite side are similar towers.</p>

<p>Several of these, which are from 8 to 10 metres high,
and well preserved, are real works of art. The mandarins
of the provinces of Ongcor and Battambong are at present
occupied in taking two of them to pieces, in order to
transport them to Bangkok, the king having issued orders
to that effect, and appointed one of the mandarins to carry
them out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Beyond, extends a second rectangular gallery, connected
with the first by three parallel galleries and two
transverse ones. At the points where they intersect are
ten towers, placed, like the galleries, in an odd and unsymmetrical
fashion. The perfect preservation of several
parts of these last, and the ruinous state of others, seem
to mark different ages.</p>

<p>One of the towers and several of the galleries are
constructed of ferruginous stone, the others of sandstone.
The architecture of the galleries is the same as that of
Ongcor-Wat, a double roof with colonnades. All the
building is on one floor. This temple, which, after Ongcor-Wat,
is the largest of all, is situated in a desert place, and
lost amidst a forest; an exuberant vegetation has overgrown
everything, galleries and towers, so that it is difficult
to force a passage.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ruins in the Province of Battambong.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">RUINS OF BATTAMBONG.</div>

<p>The principal ruins of this province are those of Bassette,
Banone, and Watêk. I visited Bassette twice, before
going to Ongcor and after; but all I could bring away
was the design of a bas-relief in perfect preservation,
carved on a block of sandstone 1 metre 50 centimetres
long, forming the top of a doorway in a brick tower. The
whole place is so ruinous, that one might suppose some
enemy had done his utmost to demolish it, or that one
gazed at the results of an earthquake. A thick vegetation,
the haunt of fierce animals, has sprung up, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
found it quite impossible to discover the plan of the
buildings. Galleries have disappeared under the ground,
and the bases of doorways are to be seen 2 metres
above.</p>

<p>The only portion which remains at all perfect is an
erection 25 metres long and 6 metres wide, divided in
two parts by an interior wall, the ends of which are in
the form of a tower. It is built entirely of stone, and
the exterior bears traces of fine carving on the tops of
the doors and on the cornices; inside, the walls are bare,
and almost all the stones chipped and injured. The
windows have been ornamented with twisted bars, of
which only a few traces remain.</p>

<p>On the ground inside lies a large broken stone, 5 decimetres
wide and 2 thick, having on each side inscriptions
apparently similar; this, and two small fractured idols
are the sole remains of Buddhism at Bassette. The
subjects, most frequently occurring over the doors, represent
men with long beards, seated, and wearing high
conical head-dresses, the hands either resting on the hilt
of a poignard or crossed one over another, elephants with
four heads, and other fanciful creatures.</p>

<p>A little beyond this enclosure is another, bounded by a
wall of sandstone, a single block forming the thickness; it
appears to have been only 75 centimetres high, and to
have served as a kind of terrace. Within this enclosure
are some magnificent columns, some still standing, others
overthrown; doorways, the upper portions of which alone
are visible above the ground; here and there fragments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
sculptured stone, towers and walls nearly destroyed, and
a beautiful dry basin, 18 metres square and above 2
metres deep, to which you descend by flights of steps
extending the entire length of each side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BASSETTE&mdash;BANONE.</div>

<p>Bassette is believed to have been the occasional residence
of the ancient sovereigns. Battambong is comparatively
modern. It is scarcely a century since Bassette
was the centre of a numerous Cambodian population,
which has entirely disappeared in consequence of the
frequent hostilities between Cambodia and Siam, the
inhabitants being led away captive by the conquerors,
who often employed this method of peopling the desert
parts of their country. It is thus that, in Siam and Laos,
entire provinces are to be found, of which the great mass
of the population are of Cambodian origin.</p>

<p>The river which formerly flowed near Bassette has been
banked up, and a new settlement, peopled from Penom-Peuh,
Udong, and other places, formed in the place now
called Battambong. Bassette is nine miles from this place,
and about as far from the mountains.</p>

<p><i>Banone.</i>&mdash;Ascending the river again for about forty
miles from Battambong in a southerly direction, you
arrive at a mountain standing somewhat isolated, but
forming part of the ramifications of the great chain of
Pursat. At the foot is a miserable pagoda of recent
origin, and in the environs a few hamlets, while on the
summit are the ruins of Banone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BANONE&mdash;WAT-EK.</div>

<p>Eight towers are connected with galleries, and com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>municate
on two sides by a wall with a central tower
nearly 8 metres in diameter. The buildings are all on
one floor, and built of sandstone, and appear of the same
date as Bassette. Although there is nothing about them
especially remarkable, what remains of the galleries displays
fine workmanship, and great taste and skill in
construction.</p>

<p>Banone must have been a temple, for there are still in
the central tower, and in two smaller ones connected by a
gallery, a great number of enormous Buddhist idols, probably
as ancient as the building itself, and surrounded
by many divinities of less size. At the foot of the neighbouring
mountains is a deep cavern in the limestone
rock, from the roof of which hang some beautiful
stalactites. The water dropping from these is considered
sacred by the Cambodians, who attribute to it, amongst
other virtues, that of imparting a knowledge of the
past, present, and future. Devotees consequently resort
hither in pilgrimage, from time to time, to gain information
as to their own fate or that of their country,
and address their prayers to the numerous idols scattered
about on the ground or placed in the cavities of the
rocks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WAT-EK.</div>

<p><i>Wat-Ek.</i>&mdash;This temple is about six miles on the other
side of Battambong, and is in tolerably good preservation.
The architecture of the galleries is full of beauty, and
that of the tower very imposing; but neither here nor at
Banone are you met by the singular grandeur and mag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>nificence
which make so great an impression on you in
visiting Ongcor and most of the other ruins.</p>

<p>Wat-Ek is situated in an immense plain, bounded north
and east by the beautiful mountains of Pursat and
ramifications of those of Chantaboun.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot nobreak">

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks on Cambodia and its Ruins.</span></p></div>


<div class="sidenote">REMARKS ON CAMBODIA.</div>

<p>A knowledge of Sanscrit, of “Pali,” and of some modern
languages of Hindostan and Indo-China, would be the
only means of arriving at the origin of the ancient people
of Cambodia who have left all these traces of their civilization,
and that of their successors, who appear only to
have known how to destroy, never to reconstruct. Until
some learned archæologist shall devote himself to this
subject, it is not probable that aught but contradictory
speculations will be promulgated. Some day, however,
the truth will surely appear and put them all to flight.
I myself, having nothing but conjecture to rest upon,
advance my own theory with diffidence.</p>

<p>Nokhor has been the centre and capital of a wealthy,
powerful, and civilized state, and in this assertion I do
not fear contradiction from those who have any knowledge
of its gigantic ruins. Now, for a country to be rich and
powerful, a produce relatively great and an extended
commerce must be presumed. Doubtless, Cambodia was
formerly thus favoured, and would be so at the present
day under a wise government, if labour and agriculture
were encouraged instead of despised, if the ruling powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
exercised a less absolute despotism, and, above all, if
slavery were abolished&mdash;that miserable institution which
is a bar to all progress, reduces man to the level of
the brute, and prevents him from cultivating more than
sufficient for his own actual wants.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The greater part of the land is surprisingly fertile,
and the rice of Battambong is superior to that of
Cochin China. The forests yield precious gums, gum-lac,
gamboge, cardamoms, and many others, as well as some
useful resins. They likewise produce most valuable
timber, both for home use and for exportation, and dye-woods
in great variety. The mines afford gold, iron, and
copper.</p>

<p>Fruits and vegetables of all kinds abound, and game
is in great profusion. Above all, the great lake is a
source of wealth to the whole nation; the fish in it are
so incredibly abundant that when the water is high they
are actually crushed under the boats, and the play of the
oars is frequently impeded by them. The quantities
taken there every year by a number of enterprising
Cochin Chinese are literally miraculous. The river of
Battambong is not less plentifully stocked, and I have
seen a couple of thousand taken in one net.</p>

<p>Neither must I omit to mention the various productions
which form so important a part of the riches of a nation,
and which might be here cultivated in the greatest per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>fection.
I would especially instance cotton, coffee, indigo,
tobacco, and the mulberry, and such spices as nutmegs,
cloves, and ginger. Even now all these are grown to a
certain limited extent, and are allowed to be of superior
quality. Sufficient cotton is raised to supply all Cochin
China, and to allow of some being exported to China
itself. From the little island of Ko-Sutin alone, leased
to the planters by the King of Cambodia, the transport
of the cotton produce employs a hundred vessels. What
might not be accomplished if these were colonies
belonging to a country such, for example, as England,
and were governed as are the dependencies of that great
and generous nation?</p>

<p>Battambong and Korat are renowned for their silken
“langoutis” of brilliant and varied colours, both the
material and the dyes being the produce of the country.</p>

<p>A glance at the map of Cambodia suffices to show that
it communicates with the sea by the numerous mouths
of the Mekong and the numberless canals of Lower
Cochin China, which was formerly subject to it; with
Laos and with China, by the great river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INHABITANTS OF CAMBODIA.</div>

<p>These facts being established, whence came the original
inhabitants of this country? Was it from India, the
cradle of civilization, or was it from China? The language
of the present natives is that of the old Cambodians
or Khendome, as they call the people who live
retired at the foot of the mountains and on the table-lands,
and it is too distinct from Chinese to render the
latter supposition possible. But whether this people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
originally came from the north or from the west, by sea,
and gradually making their way up the rivers, or from
the land, and descending them, it seems certain that there
must have been here other ancient settlers, who introduced
Buddhism and civilization. It would appear as
though these had been succeeded by some barbarous race,
who drove the original inhabitants far into the interior,
and destroyed many of their buildings. At all events,
it is my belief that, without exaggeration, the date of
some of the oldest parts of Ongcor the Great may be
fixed at more than 2000 years ago, and the more recent
portions not much later. The state of decay of many of
these structures would indicate even a greater age; but
they probably date from the dispersion of the Indian
Buddhists, which took place several centuries before the
Christian era, and which led to the expatriation of
thousands of individuals.</p>

<p>All that can be said respecting the present Cambodians
is, that they are an agricultural people, among whom a
certain taste for art still shows itself in the carved work of
the boats belonging to the better classes, and their chief
characteristic is unbounded conceit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAVAGES OF THE EAST.</div>

<p>It is not so among the savages of the east, called by
the Cambodians their elder brothers. I passed four
months among them, and, arriving direct from Cambodia,
it seemed like entering a country comparatively civilized.
Great gentleness, politeness, and even sociability&mdash;which,
to my fancy, bore evidence of a past refinement&mdash;struck
me in these poor children of nature, buried for centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in their deep forests, which they believe to be the largest
portion of the world, and to which they are so strongly
attached that no inducement would tempt them to move.
At the risk, then, of this portion of my notes being passed
over by many readers, I shall enlarge a little upon these
people, my own observations being aided by the information
afforded me by the missionaries who have for years
resided among their different tribes.</p>

<p>When looking at the figures in the bas-reliefs at
Ongcor, I could not avoid remarking the strong resemblance
of the faces to those of these savages. And besides
the similar regularity of feature, there are the same long
beards, straight langoutis, and even the same weapons and
musical instruments.</p>

<p>Almost all the fruit-trees of the neighbouring countries
are found, though in small numbers, among them; and
they have some good species of bananas, which are
unknown beyond the limits of their forests.</p>

<p>Having a great taste for music, and being gifted with
ears excessively fine, with them originated the tam-tam,
so prized among the neighbouring nations; and by
uniting its sounds to those of a large drum, they obtain
music tolerably harmonious. The art of writing is unknown
to them; and as they necessarily lead a wandering
life, they seem to have lost nearly all traditions of the
past. The only information I could extract from their
oldest chiefs was, that far beyond the chain of mountains
which crosses the country from north to south are other
“people of the high country”&mdash;such is the name they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
give themselves; that of <i>savage</i> wounds them greatly&mdash;that
they have many relations there, and they even cite
names of villages or hamlets as far as the provinces
occupied by the Annamite invaders. Their practice is to
bury their dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BANNAVS.</div>

<p>I extract the following account of the Bannavs&mdash;which
applies to most of the tribes inhabiting the mountains
and table-lands between Tonquin and Laos, Cochin China
and Cambodia&mdash;from a letter of M. Comte, missionary in
Cochin China, who recently died amongst them after a
residence of several <span class="lock">years:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“To what race do the Bannavs belong? That is the
first question I asked myself on arriving here, and I must
confess that I cannot yet answer it; all I can say is, that
in all points they differ from the Annamites and Chinese;
neither do they resemble the Laotians or Cambodians, but
appear to have a common origin with the Cédans, Halangs,
Reungao, and Giaraïe, their neighbours. Their countenances,
costumes, and belief are nearly the same; and
the language, although it differs in each tribe, has yet
many words common to all; the construction, moreover,
is perfectly identical. I have not visited the various
tribes of the south, but from all I have heard I conclude
that these observations apply to them also, and that all
the savages inhabiting the vast country lying between
Cochin China, Laos, and Cambodia belong to the same
great branch of the human family.</p>

<p>“The language spoken by the Bannavs has nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in common with that of the Annamites. Very simple in
its construction, it is soft, flowing, and easy.</p>

<p>“These people manufacture the saucepans in which
they cook their rice and wild herbs, the hatchets, pickaxes,
and pruning-bills, which comprise all their agricultural
instruments, the sabres which serve them as
weapons, and the long-handled knives used for various
kinds of work in which they excel. Their clay calumets,
tastefully ornamented with leaves or other devices, are
the production of the most skilful among the tribe. The
women weave pieces of white or black cloth, which they
use for coverings, and which, coarse as they are, form the
principal article of commerce between the Bannavs and
the Cédans.</p>

<p>“The villagers who live on the banks of the river
Bla make light canoes, which are both solid and graceful,
out of the trunks of trees. Such are the principal articles
produced by the Bannavs, who are more backward than
any of the other tribes, having little inventive genius.</p>

<p>“The Giaraïe, their neighbours on the south, show
much taste and aptness in all they do; their clothes are
of a finer texture than those spun by the Bannavs, and
are sometimes embellished with designs which would be
admired even in Europe. The iron which they forge is
also wrought into more elegant forms, and is more finely
tempered; and they manufacture some articles in copper.
Very superior to the Reungao, they do not perhaps surpass
the Halangs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Cédans are a tribe of iron-workers, their country
abounding in mines of this metal. The inhabitants
of more than seventy villages, when their agricultural
labours are over, busy themselves in extracting and
working the ore, which they afterwards dispose of in the
shape of hatchets, pickaxes, lances, and sabres.</p>

<p>“Amongst all the dwellers in a Bannav village, even
more than among the other natives, there exists a very
decided spirit of community. Thus, no family will drink
wine without inviting others to join them, as long as the
quantity will hold out; and on killing a pig, goat, or
buffalo, the possessor divides it into as many portions as
there are families, reserving for himself a share very little
larger than the others. No one is forgotten in this distribution,
from the youngest child to the oldest man. The
deer and wild boar taken in the chase are divided in the
same way, the hunters retaining only a rather larger
portion in consideration of their labour and fatigue. I
have actually seen a fowl divided into forty or fifty
parts. Even if the children catch a serpent, a lizard, or
a mouse in their little expeditions, you will see the
oldest of them, on returning, portion it with strict impartiality
amongst the party. These customs might have
been borrowed from the early Christians had these savages
ever heard of them. The other tribes also observe them,
but less scrupulously.</p>

<p>“Not only does general censure follow any criminal
act, but severe penalties, such as slavery or exile, are
imposed for lying. Even suicide&mdash;instances of which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
occasionally find among them&mdash;has a stigma affixed to it
in their penal code; any one who perishes by his own
hand is buried in a corner of the forest far from the
graves of his brethren, and all who have assisted in the
sepulture are required afterwards to purify themselves in
a special manner.</p>

<p>“This legislation is far from being deficient in morality
and wisdom, but unfortunately on certain points it is
tainted with superstition, and has opened a large door
to numberless injustices, and sometimes provoked cruel
strife. On the subject of witchcraft they are particularly
credulous: nearly every misfortune is attributed by them
to the malice of certain persons whom they believe gifted
with the power of influencing their fate; superstition
serves as a guide to seek out the guilty individual, and
when he is supposed to be discovered, he is usually sold
for a slave, or a heavy ransom is exacted.</p>

<p>“The Bannavs believe in the existence of a multitude
of spirits, some mischievous to man, others beneficent.
According to their creed, every large tree, every mountain,
every river, every rock, almost everything, has its
particular genius; but they seem to have no idea of a
superior being, sovereign and Creator of all things.</p>

<p>“If you ask them respecting the origin of mankind, all
they tell you is, that the father of the human race was
saved from an immense inundation by means of a large
chest in which he shut himself up; but of the origin or
creator of this father they know nothing. Their traditions
do not reach beyond the Deluge; but they will tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
that in the beginning one grain of rice sufficed to fill a
saucepan and furnish a repast for a whole family. This
is a souvenir of the first age of the world, that fugitive
period of innocence and happiness which poets have called
the golden age.</p>

<p>“They have no very fixed ideas on the subject of
rewards and punishments in a future life. They believe
in the immortality of the soul, which, after leaving the
body, they imagine wanders about the tombs and adjacent
mountains, often terrifying the living by nocturnal appearances,
and finally loses itself for ever in the shadowy
depths of the regions of the south.</p>

<p>“All their religion consists of sacrifices and vows, vain
and endless observances performed in the hope of warding
off misfortune, alleviating suffering, and retarding the
hour of death; for, as with all Pagans, the foundation
of their religion is terror and egotism.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIALECTS OF THE SAVAGE TRIBES.</div>

<p>On my return from my excursion amongst the Stiêns,
M. Fontaine, whom I met at Pinhalú, was so kind as
to present me with his journal, kept during a residence of
twenty years among various savage races, and which I
hope some day will see the light; and he likewise
favoured me with the following remarks on the dialects
of several of these <span class="lock">tribes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The language of the Giaraïe and that of the Redais
bear a strong resemblance to each other: the two tribes
are only separated from each other by the river Bong,
which flows between them in a westerly direction, after
running for some distance from south to north and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
watering the lands of the Candians or Bihcandians, whose
language also resembles in some degree that of the tribes
just mentioned. The dialect of the Bonnavs or Menons
does not appear to me to have any similitude to the
others, nor even to those of the tribes farther north.</p>

<p>“After a sojourn of several years among these tribes, I
was forced, on account of my health, to go to Singapore.
I was astonished, after a little study of Malayan, to find
in that language a number of Giaraïe words, and many
more bearing a strong resemblance to words in that dialect;
and I doubt not this similarity would be found still
more remarkable by any one who thoroughly studied both
languages. The resemblance also of the language of the
Thiâmes, the ancient inhabitants of Isiampa, now in the
province of Annam, to that of these tribes, leads me to
believe that they must all have sprung from the same
root.”</p>

<p>The information I obtained from the Stiêns accords
perfectly with these remarks of M. Fontaine:&mdash;“The
Thiâmes,” they said, “understand our language very well,
but the Kouïs, who live beyond the great river, speak
exactly the same language as ourselves.” M. Arnoux,
another missionary in Cochin China, who has long resided
amongst these savage tribes, speaks in the same way respecting
the language. To M. Arnoux also I owe the
exact latitude of many places on the map, and a great
deal of topographical information about the whole country;
and it affords me great pleasure here to express my gratitude
and my esteem for his character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“The languages of the Sedans,” says he, “of the Reungaos,
and of the Italhans are almost identical, although
often varying slightly even in the same tribe: the dialect
of the northern Sedans is somewhat different from that
of the southerns, and the Stiengs of Brelum speak differently
from those farther to the east.</p>

<p>“The Bannav and the Bannam are nearly the same;
the Bannav and Sedan much alike; generally only the
terminations differ, but there are words in each not to be
found in the other. M. Fontaine found that the Ieboune
and Braon strongly resemble the Bannav. I cannot
speak personally about the Giaraïe, Nedais, Bonous, and
Bih; but doubtless others can.”</p>

<p>I myself remarked many Stiên words like the Cambodian,
especially in the western districts, where there exists
some commerce between the two countries. To all this
must be added that the Siamese, Laotian,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and Cambodian
seem to be sister languages: more than a fourth
part of the words, especially those expressing intellectual
things, are exactly the same in each.</p>

<p>In the course of this work I have cited several passages
from the Life of the Abbé Gagelin, who died a martyr
in Cochin China, and which was published by Abbé
Jacquenet: in it mention is made of savage races on the
coast of Siam and in the environs of Kompat (Cambodia).
I have sought in vain for them, and no one has ever
heard them spoken of. Probably the missionary was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
deceived by his servants, who were Annamites, and they
always call the Cambodians and Siamese savages (Noye
Uhen, inhabitants of the woods), while they give themselves
the appellation of citizens.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all my efforts to discover the traces of
the probable migrations of the Jewish people through
Siam and Cambodia, I have met with nothing satisfactory
excepting a record of the judgment of Solomon, which, as
I before stated, was found by M. Miche, Bishop of Laos
and Cambodia, to be preserved <em>verbatim</em> in one of the
Cambodian sacred books. To all my questions on this
subject I received the same answer, “There are no Jews
in the country.” Nevertheless, among the Stiêns, I could
not but be struck by the Hebrew character of many of
the faces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIMITS OF CAMBODIA.</div>

<p>In 1670 Cambodia extended as far as Isiampa; but
the provinces of Lower Cochin China, as Bien-hoa, Digne-Theun,
Vigue Laon, Ann Djiann, and Ita-Tienne&mdash;all at
one time conquered and annexed&mdash;have, for more than
a century, shaken off their dependence on Cambodia; and
the language and ancient Cambodian race have entirely
disappeared in those districts. The different states have
now their limits and sovereigns entirely independent of
each other. Cambodia is, however, to a certain extent
tributary to Siam, but in no degree to Annam; and I
cannot understand how, at the present day, the French
newspapers, even the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moniteur de la Flotte</span>,’ still less
how our admiral in those seas, should habitually confound
these two countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">RELIGION OF THE THIÂMES.</div>

<p>The suppositions of the Abbé Jacquenet, which I have
already quoted and to which I was disposed to give
credence, seem to fall before the more accurate information
which I have obtained concerning the religion of
the Thiâmes or Isiampois. It must be allowed that the
only vestiges of Judaism found among them are equally
met with amongst Mahometans. They have priests,
temples, practise circumcision, abstain from pork, and
frequently pronounce, with the greatest veneration, the
words Allah and Mahomet. They themselves declare that
their present religion was brought to them from Malaisia&mdash;that
priests still come to them from thence and visit
them from time to time. I had this information from
some Cambodians of Battambong, who, having been taken
prisoners in the wars with the Cochin Chinese, passed
eight years in Isiampa. One of them, a blind man, who
appeared to me to be remarkable for good sense and
judgment&mdash;an exceptional case in this country&mdash;seemed
especially to merit confidence. These facts, and others
which I collected regarding the religion of the Thiâmes,
who until 1859, the time of their flight, inhabited Cambodia,
lead me to infer that the Abbé Gagelin was in error.
I was certainly told of two sects into which the tribe was
divided; but the only distinguishing point between them
was that one ate pork and the other did not.</p>

<p>The Thiâmes must formerly have occupied several important
districts in Cambodia, principally on the banks of
the tributary of the Me-kong. Thus, on the shores of
Touli Sap, or the great lake, not far from Battambong, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a place called Campong Thiâme (shore of the Thiâmes).
More to the south, near Campong Tchnam, the village
where the custom-house of Cambodia is erected, is an
island called Isle of Thiâmes. According to tradition, the
whole banks of the river, as far as Penom-Peuh, were formerly
inhabited by these people; and to this cause is to
be attributed the complete absence of remains in these
localities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNTAIN AND LOWLAND RACES.</div>

<p>The mountains of Dom-rêe, situated a little way to
the north of Ongcor, are inhabited by the Khmer-dôme, a
gentle and inoffensive race, although looked upon as
savages by their brethren of the plain. These latter are
the Somrais: they speak the Cambodian language, but
with a different pronunciation. Beyond are the provinces,
formerly belonging to Cambodia, but now Siamese, of
Souréne, Song Kac, Con Khan, Nan Kong, and Ongcor-Eith
or Korat.</p>

<p>According to popular belief, the king, if he should
cross the great lake, is sure to die in the course of the
year.</p>

<p>Whilst the present sovereign was prince he paid a visit
to Ongcor, and seeing some of the Somrais, said, “These
are my true subjects, and the stock from which my
family sprang.” It seems that, in fact, the present dynasty
did so.</p>

<p>The Cambodians give the following account of the introduction
of Buddhism among them. Samanokodom left
Ceylon and went to Thibet, where he was very well
received; from thence he went among the savages, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
not meeting with encouragement from them, he took refuge
in Cambodia, where he was welcomed by the people.</p>

<p>A circumstance worthy of remark is that the name of
Rome is familiar to nearly all the Cambodians: they pronounce
it Rouma, and place it at the western end of the
world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KINGS OF FIRE AND WATER.</div>

<p>There are among the Giaraïe two great nominal chiefs,
called by the Annamites Hoa-Sa and Thorei-Sa, the king
of fire and the king of water. The kings of Cambodia
and Cochin China send to the former chief, every four
or five years, a small tribute as a token of respectful
homage, in consideration of the ancient power of which
their ancestors have despoiled him. The king of fire, who
appears to be the more important of the two, is called
Eni (grandfather) by the savages, and the village where
he resides bears the same name. When this “grandfather”
dies, another is chosen, sometimes one of his sons,
sometimes a stranger, the dignity not being hereditary.
His extraordinary power is attributed, according to M.
Fontaine, to Beurdao, an old sabre wrapped in rags, and
having no other sheath. This sabre, say the Giaraïe, is
centuries old, and contains a famous spirit (Giang), who
must certainly have a good digestion to consume all the
pigs, fowls, and other offerings brought to him. It is
kept in a certain house, and whoever ventures to look at
it dies suddenly, the sole exception being Eni himself, who
has the privilege of seeing and handling it unharmed.
Every inhabitant of the village has to act as sentinel in
turn at this house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Eni wages war on no one, and is assailed by none; consequently
his attendants carry no arms when they go
round to collect offerings. Most of the people give something,
cloth, wax, pickaxes; anything is accepted.</p>

<p>I have written these few notes on Cambodia, after returning
from a long hunting expedition, by the light of a torch,
seated on my tiger-skin. On one side of me is the skin
of an ape just stripped off; on the other, a box of insects
waiting to be arranged and packed; and my employment
has not been rendered easier by the sanguinary attacks of
mosquitoes and leeches. My desire is, not to impose my
opinions on any one, especially with regard to the wonderful
architectural remains which I have visited, but simply
to disclose the existence of these monuments, which are
certainly the most gigantic, and also to my mind display
a more perfect taste than any left to us by the ancients;
and, moreover, to collect all the facts and traditions
possible about these countries, hoping they may be useful
to explorers of greater talent and fortune. For, I doubt
not, others will follow in my steps, and, aided by their own
government and by that of Siam, advantages denied to
myself, will gather an abundant harvest where I have
but cleared the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOVE OF NATURAL HISTORY.</div>

<p>But, after all, my principal object is natural history,
and with that study I chiefly occupy myself. I have
written, as I said before, in leisure hours, when resting
from my fatigues, with a desire to implant in the breasts
of others a love for the great works of Nature, and to
benefit those who, in the quiet of their homes, delight to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
follow the poor traveller; who, often with the sole object
of being useful to his fellow-men, or of discovering some
insect, plant, or unknown animal, or verifying some point
of latitude, crosses the ocean, and sacrifices family, comfort,
health, and, too often, life itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE AUTHOR’S OCCUPATIONS.</div>

<p>But it is pleasant to the man devoted to our good
and beautiful mother, Nature, to think that his work, his
fatigues, his troubles and dangers, are useful to others, if
not to himself. Nature has her lovers, and those alone
who have tasted them know the joys she gives. I candidly
confess that I have never been more happy than
when amidst this grand and beautiful tropical scenery,
in the profound solitude of these dense forests, the stillness
only broken by the song of birds and the cries of wild
animals; and even if destined here to meet my death, I
would not change my lot for all the joys and pleasures of
the civilised world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOURNEY TO BANGKOK.</div>

<p>After a sojourn of three weeks within the walls of Ongcor-Wat
in order to make drawings and plans, I returned
to Battambong. There I inquired for some means of
transport to Bangkok, but, on different pretexts, I was
detained more than two months before I could get away,
in spite of the assistance of the viceroy. At last, on the
5th March, I set off with two waggons and two pair of
powerful buffaloes, which had been taken wild, and
trained up to the yoke, and were strong enough to sustain
the fatigues of a journey at this season.</p>

<p>This time I carried along with me a complete menagerie;
but of all my prisoners a pretty young chimpanzee,
which, after slightly wounding it, we had succeeded
in taking alive, was the most amusing. As long as I kept
him in my room, and he could amuse himself with the
numerous children and other visitors whom curiosity
brought to look at him, he was very gentle; but as I
was obliged on the journey to fasten him at the back of
one of the waggons, he became frightened, and used every
effort to break his chain, continually screaming, and
trying to hide himself. After a time, however, he got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
accustomed to his position, and was quiet and docile as
before.</p>

<p>Our guns on our shoulders, I and my young Chinese
Phrai followed or walked before the waggons, occasionally
finding some sport as we skirted the forest. As
for my other servant, when we reached Pinhalú he begged
to be allowed to return to Bangkok by our former route;
so, not wishing to retain him against his will, I paid his
expenses home, and wished him happiness.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we proceeded a mile when our drivers
asked my permission to stop for supper, saying that afterwards
we could set out again, and travel part of the night.
I at once consented, knowing it to be a custom with the
Cambodians, before departing on a long journey, to make
their first halt not far from their village, that they may
return home to shed a last tear, and partake of a farewell
glass.</p>

<p>Before the oxen were even unyoked, the families of
our drivers were all collected round me, the whole party
talking at once, and begging me to take care of their
relations, to save them from robbers, and give them medicine
if they had a headache. They all then took their
evening meal together, washing it down with some glasses
of arrack which I gave them; after which we resumed
our journey by a magnificent moonlight, but treading in a
bed of dust which reached to our ankles, and raised a thick
cloud round our waggons.</p>

<p>We encamped part of the night near a small piece
of water, where some custom-house officers are stationed&mdash;three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
poor wretches&mdash;whose duty it is to arrest the depredators
who lie in wait for the buffaloes and elephants
coming down here from the lake and neighbouring districts.
Those among us who had mats, spread them on
the ground, and lay down; those who had none, piled up
grass and leaves for beds.</p>

<p>For three days we travelled northward until we reached
Ongcor-Borige, chief town of a province of the same
name; but, surprised by darkness and a heavy storm, we
were compelled to halt at the outskirts. The next morning,
as we were leaving the place, we fell in with a caravan
of thirty waggons conveying rice to Muang-Kabine,
whither we were ourselves going; so my Cambodians
fraternised with the party, all breakfasting together, and
two hours afterwards we set off again at the head of this
line of waggons.</p>

<p>There is here an immense plain, almost a desert, which
in the best season takes six days to cross with elephants,
and twelve with waggons. As for us, we set out on the
5th March, and only reached Muang-Kabine on the 28th;
and oh! what we suffered from ennui, from heat, from
attacks of mosquitoes, and want of water. In addition to
these miseries my feet became like a jelly; and, when we
arrived at our destination, I could scarcely drag myself
along, or keep up with the slow but regular step of the
buffaloes.</p>

<p>Some days before reaching Muang-Kabine we had to
ford a small river, the Bang-Chang, and here we obtained
some good water; but all the rest of the journey we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
nothing but the water from the muddy pools, serving for
baths and drinking-places to all the buffaloes of the caravan.
When I drank it, or used it for cooking or tea, I
purified it with a little alum, a better method than filtering.
Every day some accident happened to our waggons, which
was one cause of our being so long on the road.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Muang-Kabine we found great excitement
prevailing on account of a recent discovery of gold-mines,
which had attracted to the place a number of
Laotians, Chinese, and Siamese. The mines of Battambong,
being less rich, are not so much frequented. From
Muang-Kabine I continued my route to Paknam, where
I hired a boat to take me to Bangkok.</p>

<p class="caption">VIEW IN THE GULF OF SIAM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first day’s navigation was very tedious, the water
being shallow, and the sand-banks in many places bare,
but the day following we were able to lay aside our poles,
and take to the oars. The stream takes a bend towards
the south, and empties itself into the gulf a little above
Petrin, a district which produces all the sugar of Siam,
which is sold at Bangkok.</p>

<p>This canal connects the Menam and the Bang-Chang,
which afterwards takes the name of Bang-Pakong; it is
nearly sixty miles in length, and was the work of a clever
Siamese general, the same who, twenty years ago, retook
Battambong from the Cochin-Chinese. He is also noted
for having constructed a fine road from Paknam to
Ongcor-Borige, the place where the great inundations
have their limit. This road I could not make use of, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
at this season I should have found neither water nor grass
for my oxen.</p>

<p>On the banks of the Bang-Pakong are several Cambodian
villages, peopled by prisoners from Battambong; and
along the canal, on either side, is a mixed, and for this
country numerous population, of Malays, Laotians from
the peninsula, and Laotians from Vien-Chan, a district on
the banks of the Mekong, north-east of Korat, and now
depopulated by frequent revolts.</p>

<p>Although overburdened with taxes, yet, to judge from
their clean and comfortable dwellings, and a certain air
of well-doing which reigns in these villages, the inhabitants
must enjoy some degree of prosperity, especially since
the impulse given to commerce by the Europeans settled
in the capital.</p>

<p>The water was so thickly covered with weeds that
our progress was much impeded, and we were three days
in the canal; while, after May, it only takes the same
time to go from Paknam to Bangkok.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT BANGKOK.</div>

<p>On the 4th April I returned to the capital, after fifteen
months’ absence. During the greater part of this time I
had never known the comfort of sleeping in a bed; and
throughout my wanderings my only food had been rice or
dried fish, and I had not once tasted good water. I was
astonished at having preserved my health so well, particularly
in the forests, where, often wet to the skin, and without
a change of clothes, I have had to pass whole nights by a
fire at the foot of a tree; yet I have not had a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
attack of fever, and been always happy and in good
spirits, especially when lucky enough to light upon some
novelty. A new shell or insect filled me with a joy which
ardent naturalists alone can understand; but they know
well how little fatigues and privations of all kinds are
cared for when set against the delight experienced in
making one discovery after another, and in feeling that
one is of some slight assistance to the votaries of science.
It pleases me to think that my investigations into the
archæology, entomology, and conchology of these lands
may be of use to certain members of the great and generous

</div>

<div class="sidenote">NEWS FROM EUROPE.</div>

<p>It was another great pleasure to me, after these fifteen
months of travelling, during which very few letters from
home had reached me, to find, on arriving at Bangkok, an
enormous packet, telling me all the news of my distant
family and country. It is indeed happiness, after so long
a period of solitude, to read the lines traced by the beloved
hands of an aged father, of a wife, of a brother.
These joys are to be reckoned among the sweetest and
purest of life.</p>

<p>We stopped in the centre of the town, at the entrance
of a canal, whence there is a view over the busiest part
of the Menam. It was almost night, and silence reigned
around us; but when at daybreak I rose and saw the ships
lying at anchor in the middle of the stream, while the
roofs of the palaces and pagodas reflected the first rays of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the sun, I thought that Bangkok had never looked so
beautiful. However, life here would never suit me, and
the mode of locomotion is wearisome after an active existence
among the woods and in the chase.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PORT AND TOWN OF BANGKOK.</div>

<p>The river is constantly covered with thousands of boats
of different sizes and forms, and the port of Bangkok is
certainly one of the finest in the world, without excepting
even the justly-renowned harbour of New York. Thousands
of vessels can find safe anchorage here.</p>

<p>The town of Bangkok increases in population and extent
every day, and there is no doubt but that it will
become a very important capital: if France succeeds in
taking possession of Annam, the commerce between the
two countries will increase. It is scarcely a century old,
and yet contains nearly half a million of inhabitants,
amongst whom are many Christians. The flag of France
floating in Cochin China would improve the position of
the missions in all the surrounding countries; and I have
reason to hope that Christianity will increase more rapidly
than it has hitherto done.</p>

<p>I had intended to visit the north-east of the country of
Laos, crossing Dong Phya Phai (the forest of the King
of Fire), and going on to Hieng Naie, on the frontiers of
Cochin China; thence to the confines of Tonquin. I had
planned to return afterwards by the Nékong to Cambodia,
and then to pass through Cochin China, should the
arms of France have been victorious there. However,
the rainy season having commenced, the whole country
was inundated, and the forests impassable; so it was neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>sary
to wait four months before I could put my project in
execution. I therefore packed up and sent off all my
collections, and after remaining a few weeks in Bangkok
I departed for Pechaburi, situated about 13° north lat.,
and to the north of the Malayan peninsula.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE FOR PECHABURI.</div>

<p>On the 8th May, at five o’clock in the evening, I sailed
from Bangkok in a magnificent vessel ornamented with
rich gilding and carved-work, belonging to Khrom Luang,
one of the king’s brothers, who had kindly lent it to a
valued friend of mine. There is no reason for concealing
the name of this gentleman, who has proved himself a
real friend in the truest meaning of the word; but I rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
embrace the opportunity of testifying my affection and
gratitude to M. Malherbes, who is a French merchant
settled at Bangkok. He insisted on accompanying me
for some distance, and the few days he passed with me
were most agreeable ones.</p>

<p>The current was favourable, and, with our fifteen
rowers, we proceeded rapidly up the stream. Our boat,
adorned with all sorts of flags, red streamers, and peacocks’
tails, attracted the attention of all the European residents,
whose houses are built along the banks of the stream,
and who, from their verandahs, saluted us by cheering
and waving their hands. Three days after leaving Bangkok
we arrived at Pechaburi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING’S BROTHER.</div>

<p>The king was expected there the same day, to visit a
palace which he has had built on the summit of a hill near
the town. Khrom Luang, Kalahom (prime minister), and
a large number of mandarins had already assembled.
Seeing us arrive, the prince called to us from his pretty
little house; and as soon as we had put on more suitable
dresses we waited on him, and he entered into conversation
with us till breakfast-time. He is an excellent
man, and, of all the dignitaries of the country, the one
who manifests least reserve and hauteur towards Europeans.
In education, both this prince and the king are
much advanced, considering the state of the country; but
in their manners they have little more refinement than
the people generally.</p>

<p class="caption">HALL OF AUDIENCE, PALACE OF BANGKOK.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">PECHABURI.</div>

<p>Our first walk was to the hill on which the palace
stands. Seen from a little distance, this building, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
European construction, presents a very striking appearance;
and the winding path which leads up to it has been
admirably contrived amidst the volcanic rocks, basalt, and
scoria which cover the surface of this ancient crater.</p>

<p>About twenty-five miles off, stretches from north to
south a chain of mountains called Deng, and inhabited
by the independent tribes of the primitive Kariens.
Beyond these rise a number of still higher peaks. On
the low ground are forests, palm-trees, and rice-fields, the
whole rich and varied in colour. Lastly, to the south and
east, and beyond another plain, lies the gulf, on whose
waters, fading away into the horizon, a few scattered sails
are just distinguishable.</p>

<p>It was one of those sights not to be soon forgotten, and
the king has evinced his taste in the selection of such a
spot for his palace. No beings can be less poetical or
imaginative than the Indo-Chinese; their hearts never
appear to expand to the genial rays of the sun; yet they
must have some appreciation of this beautiful scenery, as
they always fix upon the finest sites for their pagodas and
palaces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GROTTOES.</div>

<p>Quitting this hill, we proceeded to another, like it an
extinct volcano or upheaved crater. Here are four or
five grottoes, two of which are of surprising extent, and
extremely picturesque. A painting which represented
them faithfully would be supposed the offspring of a fertile
imagination; no one would believe it to be natural. The
rocks, long in a state of fusion, have taken, in cooling,
those singular forms peculiar to scoria and basalt. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
after the sea had retreated&mdash;for all these rocks have risen
from the bottom of the water&mdash;owing to the moisture
continually dripping through the damp soil, they have
taken the richest and most harmonious colours. These
grottoes, moreover, are adorned by such splendid stalactites,
which, like columns, seem to sustain the walls and
roofs, that one might fancy oneself present at one of the
beautiful fairy scenes represented at Christmas in the
London theatres.</p>

<p>If the taste of the architect of the king’s palace has
failed in the design of its interior, here, at least, he has
made the best of all the advantages offered to him by
nature. A hammer touching the walls would have disfigured
them; he had only to level the ground, and to
make staircases to aid the descent into the grottoes, and
enable the visitor to see them in all their beauty.</p>

<p>The largest and most picturesque of the caverns has
been made into a temple. All along the sides are rows
of idols, one of superior size, representing Buddha asleep,
being gilt.</p>

<p>We came down from the mountain just at the moment
of the king’s arrival. Although his stay was not intended
to exceed two days, he was preceded by a hundred slaves
carrying an immense number of coffers, boxes, baskets,
&amp;c. A disorderly troop of soldiers marched both in front
and behind, dressed in the most singular and ridiculous
costumes imaginable. The emperor Soulouque himself
would have laughed, for certainly his old guard must have
made a better appearance than that of his East Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
brother. Nothing could give a better idea of this set
of tatterdemalions than the dressed-up monkeys which
dance upon the organs of the little Savoyards. Their
apparel of coarse red cloth upper garments, which left
a part of the body exposed, in every case either too
large or too small, too long or too short, with white shakos,
and pantaloons of various colours; as for shoes, they were
a luxury enjoyed by few.</p>

<p>A few chiefs, whose appearance was quite in keeping
with that of their men, were on horseback, leading this
band of warriors, whilst the king, attended by slaves, slowly
advanced in a little open carriage drawn by a pony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLAGUE OF MOSQUITOES.</div>

<p>I visited several hills detached from the great chain
Khao Deng, which is only a few miles off. During my
stay here it has rained continually, and I have had to
wage war with savage foes, from whom I never before
suffered so much. Nothing avails against them; they let
themselves be massacred, with a courage worthy of nobler
beings. I speak of mosquitoes. Thousands of these cruel
insects suck our blood night and day. My body, face,
and hands are covered with wounds and blisters. I would
rather have to deal with the wild beasts of the forest.
At times I howl with pain and exasperation. No one
can imagine the frightful plague of these little demons, to
whom Dante has omitted to assign a place in his infernal
regions. I scarcely dare to bathe, for my body is covered
before I can get into the water. The natural philosopher
who held up these little animals as examples of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
parental love was certainly not tormented as I have
been.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LAOTIANS.</div>

<p>About ten miles from Pechaburi I found several villages
inhabited by Laotians, who have been settled there for
two or three generations. Their costume consists of a
long shirt and black pantaloons, like those of the Cochin
Chinese, and they have the Siamese tuft of hair. The
women wear the same head-dress as the Cambodians.
Their songs, and their way of drinking through bamboo
pipes, from large jars, a fermented liquor made from rice
and herbs, recalled to my mind what I had seen among
the savage Stiêns. I also found among them the same
baskets and instruments used by those tribes.</p>

<p>The young girls are fair compared with the Siamese,
and their features are pretty; but they soon grow coarse,
and lose all their charms. Isolated in their villages,
these Laotians have preserved their language and customs,
and they never mingle with the Siamese.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Return to Bangkok&mdash;Preparations for a new Expedition to
the North-East of Laos&mdash;Phrabat&mdash;Pakpriau&mdash;Saohaïe.</span></p></div>


<p>After a sojourn of four months among the mountains
of Pechaburi, known by the names of Makaon Khao,
Panam Knot, Khao Tamoune, and Khao Samroun, the last
two of which are 1700 and 1900 feet above the level
of the sea, I returned to Bangkok to make the necessary
preparations for my new expedition to the north-east
of Laos, my intended route being to the basin of
the Mekong, towards the frontier of China. I had an
additional motive for coming here again, namely, to get
cured of that annoying complaint the itch, which I caught
at Pechaburi; how, I really cannot guess, for, in spite of
the mosquitoes, I bathed regularly two or three times a
day; but I hope that a short course of rubbing with
sulphur ointment, and proper baths, will effect a cure.
This, one of the ills of a traveller’s life, is, however,
trifling in comparison with the misfortune of which I have
just heard. The steamer ‘Sir James Brooke,’ in which
Messrs. Gray, Hamilton, and Co., of Singapore, had sent
off all my last boxes of collections, has foundered at the
entrance of that port. And so all my poor insects, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
have cost me so much care and pains for many months,
are lost for ever&mdash;some of them rare and valuable
specimens, which, alas! I shall probably never be able
to replace.</p>

<p class="caption">PAVILION CONTAINING THE ASHES OF THE LATE KING OF SIAM IN THE GARDENS ATTACHED TO THE PALACE AT BANGKOK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Two years ago, about this same season, I was nearly in
the same place where I now am, on the Menam, some
leagues north of Bangkok. The last floating shops, with
their almost exclusively Chinese population, are beginning
to disappear, and the banks of the river are assuming a
monotonous aspect, although from time to time, through
the brushwood and foliage of the bananas, the roof of
some hut is visible, or the white walls of a pagoda, prettily
situated, and surrounded by the modest dwellings of the
priests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FÊTES AT BANGKOK.</div>

<p>It is the season of fêtes; the stream is covered with
large and handsome boats, decorated with gilding and
carved work, with true oriental gorgeousness; and among
them the heavy barges of the rice-merchants, or the small
craft of poor women going to the market with bananas
and betel-nuts. It is only on festivals, and a few other
occasions, that the king, princes, and mandarins display
their riches and importance. The king was on his way to
a pagoda to offer presents, followed by his whole court.
Each of the mandarins was in a splendid barge, the
rowers being dressed in the most brilliant colours. A
number of pirogues were filled with soldiers in red coats.
The royal barge was easily to be distinguished from the
rest, by the throne surmounted by a canopy terminating
in a pinnacle, and by the immense quantity of carving and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
gilding about it. At the king’s feet were some of his
children, and he waved his hand to every European whom
he saw.</p>

every floating house had an altar covered with various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
objects, and with odoriferous woods burning on them.
Amidst all these fine barges, one was remarkable for its
simplicity, and the good taste with which the rowers were
dressed,&mdash;a uniform of white cloth, with red cuffs and
collar. It belonged to Khrom Luang, the king’s brother,
a good, courteous, and intelligent prince, ever ready to
protect Europeans to the utmost of his power; in a word,
a gentleman.</p>

<p>Most of the dignitaries, generally fat men, were lying
lazily on triangular embroidered cushions, in their splendid
boats, upon a kind of dais, surrounded by officials, women,
and children, kneeling, or lying flat, in readiness to hold
out the golden urns which serve them for spittoons, or
their betel-boxes or teapots, all made of the same precious
metals by the goldsmiths of Laos and Ligor. The boats
have generally from eighty to a hundred rowers, with the
head and greater part of the body bare, but wearing a
large white scarf round the loins, and a brilliant red
<i>langouti</i>; they all raise their paddles simultaneously, and
strike the water in regular time, while at the prow and
stern are stationed two other slaves, one dexterously
managing a long oar which serves as a rudder, the other
on the watch to prevent a collision with any other boat.
The rowers continually raise a wild, exulting cry, “Ouah!
ouah!” while the steersman utters a louder and more
prolonged one, which rises above the voices of the rest.
Many boats also are to be seen crowded with women,
musicians, or parties carrying presents. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’œil</i>
is certainly charming.</p>

up or down the river, being often skilfully managed by
girls and very young children, who amused themselves
by racing. It is evident, from the careless gaiety of these
people, that they do not suffer the frightful poverty
but too often met with in our large cities. When his
appetite is satisfied&mdash;and, for that, all that is necessary
is a bowl of rice, and some fish seasoned with capsicum&mdash;the
Siamese is lively and happy, and sleeps without

<div class="sidenote">PAIN OF SEPARATION.</div>

<p>My friend M. Malherbes accompanied me for a few
hours’ sail from Bangkok, and then we parted with a
warm clasp of the hand, and, I confess, not without tears
in both our eyes, trusting that destiny might reunite us
here or elsewhere. My friend’s light boat glided rapidly
down the stream; in a few minutes he was out of sight,
and I was again left alone&mdash;for how long a period being
quite uncertain. I rarely allow myself to dwell on the
subject; but separations are painful to the traveller who
has left behind him all he holds most dear in the world,&mdash;family,
country, home, and friends,&mdash;to visit countries
inhospitable, and in many ways dangerous, without
comfort or companionship. It is equally painful to think
that, during long months, his impatient family are living
in anxiety, and forming a thousand conjectures as to his
fate. I know what awaits me, having been warned both
by the missionaries and the natives. During the last
twenty-five years, only one man, as far as I know, a
French priest, has penetrated to the heart of Laos, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
he only returned to die in the arms of the good and
venerable prelate, Mgr. Pallegoix. I know the discomfort,
fatigue, and tribulations of all sorts to which I am again
about to expose myself; the want of roads, the difficulty
of finding means of conveyance, and the risk of paying
for the slightest imprudence by a dangerous or even
fatal illness. And how can one be prudent when compelled
to submit to the hardest life of the forest, to
suffer many privations, and to brave all inclemencies of
the weather? Nevertheless, my destiny urges me on, and
I trust in the kind Providence which has watched over me
until now.</p>

<p>Only a few hours before my departure from Bangkok,

in the loss of my collections. Thanks, thanks, my good
friends, for the pleasure you gave me before starting, by
the expression of your warm and constant affection; I

my little adventures, very rare, alas! for I am not one

one shot; the smallest unknown shell or insect is more
interesting to me; however, on occasion, I do not object
to a meeting with the terrible inhabitants of the forest,
and more than one have known the range of my rifle and
the calibre of my balls.</p>

<p>Every evening, enclosed in my mosquito curtains,
either in some cabin or at the foot of a tree, in the jungle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>

the name of M. D’Istria, the new French Consul.</p>

<p>Let me say, in passing, that I am cured of the itch,
which I suspect my servants had caught in wandering
about the villages, and had communicated to me, in spite
of my scrupulous cleanliness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TRAVELLER’S SERVANTS.</div>

<div>The banks of the Menam are covered with splendid
crops, the periodical inundations rendering them as fertile
as those of the Nile. I have four Laotian rowers; one
of them was in my service for a month two years ago, and
he now begged to be allowed to attend me throughout
my journey, telling me I should find him very useful.
After a little hesitation I have engaged him, so now I
shall have three servants. My good and faithful Phrai
has never left me, luckily for me, for I should find it
difficult to replace him; and, besides, I am attached to
the lad, who is active, intelligent, industrious, and devoted
to me.


<div class="sidenote">THE CHINESE “DENG.”</div>

Deng&mdash;which means “The Red”&mdash;his companion,
is another Chinese whom I brought from Pechaburi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
He knows English pretty well; not that incomprehensible
jargon of Canton, “You savee one piccey boy,
lartel pigeon,” &amp;c. (You know a clever boy, &amp;c.) He is
very useful to me as interpreter, especially when I wish
to comprehend persons who speak with a great piece of
betel between their teeth. He is likewise my cook, and
shows his skill when we want to add an additional dish to
our ordinary fare, which occasionally happens when some
unfortunate stag comes within range of my gun, or I
bring down a pigeon, or even a monkey, a kind of game
not much to my taste, though highly esteemed by my
Chinese, as well as wild dog and rat. Every one to his taste.</div>

<div class="sidenote">DENG’S DRAUGHT.</div>

<p>This attendant of mine has one little defect, but who
has not in this world? He now and then takes a drop too
much, and I have often found him sucking, through a
bamboo cane, the spirit of wine from one of the bottles
in which I preserve my reptiles, or laying under contribution
the cognac presented to me by my friend
Malherbes. A few days ago he was seized with this
devouring thirst, and, profiting by my absence for only
a few minutes, he opened my chest, and hastily laid hands
on the first bottle which presented itself, great part of
the contents of which he swallowed at one gulp. I came
back just as he was wiping his mouth with his shirt-sleeve,
and it would be impossible to describe his contortions
and grimaces as he screamed out that he was
poisoned.</p>

<p>He had had the bad luck to get hold of my bottle of
ink; his face was smeared with it, and his shirt pretty
well sprinkled. It was a famous lesson for him, and I
think it will be some time before he tries my stores
again.</p>

<p>The wages I give at present are ten ticals each per
month, which, allowing for exchange, amounts to nearly
forty francs per month. This in any other country would
be good pay; but here I should find great difficulty in
finding any other men to accompany me, were I to offer
them a tical a day.</p>

<p>I soon reached the mountains of Nephaburi and
Phrabat, with their pure clear atmosphere, the weather
being pleasant and a fresh wind blowing. All nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
looks smiling, and I feel exhilarated and happy. At
Bangkok I felt stifled and oppressed. That town does
not awaken my sympathies. Here my heart dilates, and
I could fancy I had grown ever so much taller since I
arrived. Here I can breathe, I live, amid these beautiful
hills and woods; in cities I seem to suffocate,
and the sight of so great a number of human beings
annoys me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMMENCEMENT OF RICE-HARVEST.</div>

<p>I stopped yesterday at Ayuthia to see Father Larmandy,
and, after a night passed beneath his hospitable
roof, proceeded on my way towards Pakpriau. The whole
day after our departure we passed by fields and rice-plantations
on both sides of the river. All the country,
till within two miles of Ayuthia, is inundated; there,
only, the ground begins to rise a foot above the waters.
Already, in several places they are beginning to cut the
rice, and in a fortnight the whole population, male and
female, will be busy with the harvest.</p>

<p>At present most of them are availing themselves of
the short time left them to enjoy the “far niente,” or
visit the pagodas with offerings to the priests, which
consist principally of fruit and yellow cloth; the latter
intended to afford a supply of raiment for them while
they are travelling; as, during several months of the dry
season, they are allowed to quit their monasteries and
go where they like.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VISIT TO KHUN PAKDY.</div>

<p>October 20.&mdash;Having reached Thama Triestard at
night, we slept at the entrance of the village, and early
this morning I stopped my boat before the house of Khun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Pakdy, the kind chief who, two years ago, accompanied
me to Phrabat. The worthy man was not a little surprised
to see me, and could scarcely believe his eyes, for
he had heard that I had died at Muang-Kabuic. We
soon renewed our acquaintance, and I was pleased to find
that his regard for me, especially when stimulated by a
glass of cognac, had survived the lapse of time. Poor
Khun Pakdy! if I were King of Siam&mdash;which Heaven
forbid!&mdash;I would name you Prince of Phrabat, or rather
resign my throne to you.</p>

<p>He gave immediate orders to prepare breakfast for
me; then, on finding that I was going to Korat, he
remembered that he had promised again to be my companion
if I brought him a gun from Bangkok. “If it
were only worth three ticals it would do,” said he; but
seeing only the same percussion guns, “You have not
brought me one,” he observed; “but never mind, I will
go with you all the same.” It was only when I told him
that I should make but a very short stay at Korat, and
intended to proceed farther on into places where he would
doubtless have to “tighten his belt,” and that I did not
wish him to lose his comfortable mandarin’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</i>,
that I succeeded in checking his enthusiastic devotion.
But when he heard that we should be obliged to sleep
among the woods by the light of the stars, he turned the
conversation.</p>

<p>As soon as we had breakfasted I returned to my boat
to escape his rather too demonstrative conversation, and
the noisy eulogiums he continued to pour upon me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>From hence are visible the beautiful chain of hills
which extend from Nephaburi, and which, I conjecture,
join those of Birmanie and the Deng mountains, which
do not appear more than fifteen miles off, and awaken a
host of agreeable recollections. I feel sure the fine season
has arrived; the air is pure, the sky serene, and the sun
shines almost constantly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAOHAIE.</div>

<p>Saohaïe, October 22.&mdash;I have not yet reached Pakpriau,
and already I have met with, and begun to suffer from,
the annoyances inevitable in a country like this, inundated
during a great part of the year, and in which the means
of travelling are so difficult to obtain, particularly when
one is burdened with an extra, though indispensable,
quantity of luggage.</p>

<p>During the two days I have been here I have lodged
in the boat of a Chinese who was at first afraid to receive
me; and I may consider myself fortunate in meeting
with any resting-place. Yesterday I paid a visit to the
governor, who resides in an old hut, repulsively dirty,
about two miles from the spot where I landed. Although
this is the most important place in Saraburi, this wretched
dwelling, and a few scattered huts belonging to agriculturists,
are all the houses I have seen; there is no bazaar,
and no floating shops. From time to time petty merchants
come to sell or exchange salt and other articles
of absolute necessity; or a few Chinese with small stocks
of <i>langoutis</i>, arrack, cloth, Siamese dresses, and bowls,
which they barter for skins, horns, or rice. These dealers
sometimes go as far as Boatioume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The current was so strong, that in a quarter of an hour
we reached the residence of the mandarin whose acquaintance
I had made on my former journey, and who, in
return for a present I had given him, had promised me,
in the event of my going to Korat, to furnish me with
even a hundred attendants, if I needed as many. I
announced to him my intention of visiting Khao-Khoc,
fixed upon two years ago by the King of Siam as a
desirable place for a fortress to which he might retire,
in case the too active Europeans should seize upon his
capital&mdash;which, let me whisper, would be very easy to do,
and would only require a handful of our brave Zouaves
accustomed to an African sun.</p>

<p>I was all the better received by the mandarin, that I
asked for nothing; for I had already engaged a boat, the
owner of which wished to return to Khao-Khoc in two
days. I had projected a trip to Patawi, but at this season
the roads are impassable, so that I was forced to abandon
the idea.</p>

<p>A great number of the inhabitants of this province
are natives of Laos, and are principally captives brought
from Vien Chang after the insurrection there. The provinces
of Boatioume and Petchaboune are peopled by
Siamese, for Laos proper only commences at M’Lôm.
Boatioume, Petchaboune, Sôm, and some other provinces
in the north and east, are governed by Siamese mandarins
of rank more or less elevated; that is to say,
several of them have the power of life and death, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
then considered as viceroys. The most distant provinces
belong to the empire of Siam, and form a part of it.</p>

<p>Petchaboune is particularly noted for its tobacco, which
is reckoned the best in Siam; and a commerce in this
article is carried on with Bangkok in spite of the extreme
difficulty of communication; for in the time of the
inundations, when boats of some size are able to come up
here, the contending against a very strong current is the
labour of a month; while in the dry season only very
small boats can be used, as, frequently, they have to be
dragged over the sand, or carried past the rocks, which in
many places cause rapids and obstruct the navigation.
This commerce is chiefly in the hands of the Siamese of
Petchaboune, who arrive at Pakpriau towards the end of
the rainy season, to exchange their tobacco for betel and
other articles.</p>

<p>The province of Saraburi is very populous, and in the
southern districts a great quantity of rice is produced,
but the quality of it is inferior to that of Pechaburi,
which is considered very good, and is regularly bought by
the Siamese dealers, who afterwards carry it to Bangkok.
As is the case all over the country, there is great difficulty
in arriving at a correct estimate of the population, which
is scattered along the banks of the stream.</p>

<p>Saohaïe is the starting-point for all the caravans going
to Korat. Another road, from Muang-Kabuic, also leads
to this ancient Cambodian town; but it is little frequented,
except by the Laotians of the locality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">VISIT FROM THE GOVERNOR.</div>

<p>Whilst writing I was interrupted by the unexpected
visit of the governor, who was on his way to a pagoda to
make an offering of dried fruits, and passed an hour in my
cabin. He was in a large and elegant pirogue more than
30 metres long, for which I would have given his house
and all its appurtenances. He sent for the owner of the
boat which was to take me to Khao-Khoc, and gave him
some instructions for the chief of that place, adding, “I
have sent no letter, because I know that M. Mouhot made
himself respected when here two years ago, and will
doubtless do the same there.” I could not but offer him
some small presents in acknowledgment of this slight
service, which might or might not be of use to me. I
therefore gave him a pair of spectacles mounted in tortoiseshell,
a bottle of scent, and one of brandy; and I
prepared for him a sedative mixture, as he begged for some
medicine for his rheumatism. Happy Raspail! who, with
his “system,” can assuage suffering even in these distant
lands.</p>

<p>In return, he promised to give me a pony when I
wanted to go to Korat, besides other useless things;
but he will probably forget these promises, for here it is
the custom of the rich to accept everything even from the
poorest, but very rarely to give away. However, were it
not for peculation and presents, how could these mandarins
live? Their salary&mdash;when they have one&mdash;would
condemn them to a state of leanness which would not
only drive them to despair, but cause them to be looked
upon as unsuitable for their places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Voyage to Khao-Khoc.&mdash;Dong Phya Phai (Forest
of the King of Fire).</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">VOYAGE TO KHAO-KHOC.</div>

<p>I am now en route for Khao-Khoc, in the boat of a
Chinese merchant, a worthy person, who, luckily for me,
does not intoxicate himself with opium or arrack. He
intends going as far as Boatioume, but the current is so
strong that I doubt if he will be able to proceed higher
up the river than Khao-Khoc; for, in spite of his four
rowers, and the aid of my two men&mdash;(I sent away my Laotian,
who found it too great fatigue to row, and preferred
sleeping and smoking)&mdash;we have been nearly carried away
at every bend of the river and at the frequent rapids.</p>

<p>The weather, which I trusted was settled, has changed
during the last three days, and every afternoon, about
four or five o’clock, we have a violent shower. Last
evening I was seized with a more severe headache than
any I have had since I entered the country, and my first
impression was that I had been attacked by fever, which,
in the rainy season, there is so much cause to dread in
the neighbourhood of Dong Phya Phai. It proceeded,
however, only from the heat of the sun, to which I had
been all day exposed, and was dissipated by the freshness
of the night air at the prow of the boat. In the morning
I felt as well as usual.</p>

<p>They tell me that to-morrow I shall see Khao-Khoc, and
I shall not be at all sorry. The little boat is so encumbered
with our united baggage, that the fraction of space
left for me forces me to all sorts of constrained and uncomfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
positions; and these twelve days of tedious
navigation have fatigued me much. And what a place
this is! The air is damp, unwholesome, and dreadfully
heavy; one’s head burns, while one’s body is at one time
covered with perspiration, and at another a cold shivering
comes on.</p>

<p>After four days of excessive toil we entered a gorge
through which the river passes, which, even at this season,
is here not more than 90 metres wide. Torrents of rain,
bursting suddenly upon us, forced us to stop rowing, and
take refuge under our roof of leaves. The rain lasted all
night, and a wretched night it was for the poor men, who,
having yielded to me the front of the boat, were all
crammed together in the cabin, and, after all their fatigues
under a burning sun, were unable to obtain a moment’s
sleep, but lay groaning under the suffocating atmosphere
and the attacks of legions of mosquitoes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KHAO-KHOC.</div>

<p>At daybreak about a hundred strokes of the oar brought
us past a new bend in the river, and we found ourselves
before Khao-Khoc. This place has, in my humble
opinion, been badly chosen by the kings of Siam for their
stronghold and retreat in case of an European invasion
of the south. In the event of this occurring, they would
abandon Bangkok; and, certainly, as whoever possesses
that town is master of the whole country, no one would be
likely to come and molest the kings in their solitude.</p>

<p>Two or three miles below Khao-Khoc I observed a kind
of landing-place, and a house of mediocre appearance,
bearing the pretentious appellation of palace, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
built only of leaves and bamboo. This is Rabat Moi.
At Khao-Khoc, although the second king often visits it,
there is no landing-place, nor even steps cut in the
steep banks to aid the ascent.</p>

<p>Immediately after landing I set off to look for a lodging,
having been informed that I should find numerous vacant
houses belonging to mandarins, amongst which I might
make my choice. My men and I hunted amid the
brushwood, often sinking up to our knees in mud, but
could discover only seven or eight Laotian huts, the
inhabitants of which form the nucleus of the population
of this future stronghold, now peaceful and hospitable
agriculturists, who would be deeply afflicted, and still
more terrified, if ever their echoes should repeat the roar
of cannon and varied sounds of war. As for the royal
habitations, I could not reach them, for the whole ground,
excepting a strip about fifty feet broad next the river, is
a swamp; and the narrow paths are obstructed by bushes
and tall grass, which had had time to grow during the six
or eight months that have elapsed since the King has
visited the place.</p>

<p>Not being able to find a lodging, some men from the
village joined us, and we all set to work to cut down bamboos,
with which to construct one, which was soon accomplished;
and in this hut, open to every wind, we took up
our abode.</p>

<p>I was told that a white elephant had just been taken
in Laos, and had been sent off to Bangkok under the
care of a mandarin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>All the inhabitants of the village, amounting perhaps
to about fifty, have brought their children to me, begging
for remedies; some for fevers, others for dysentery or
rheumatism. I have not heard of any cases of leprosy
here, as at Khao-Tchioulaü, but the children are repulsively
dirty; they are covered with a coating of filth,
which makes them resemble little negroes, and the greater
number of them are shaking with fever.</p>

<p>The site of my hut is in a valley, formed by a belt
of mountain-chains, running from Nephaburi and Phrabat,
and connected with those of the peninsula and of Birmah.
Mount Khoc is distant a kilometre from the left bank of
the river, and stretches out in the form of a semicircle,
afterwards joining the mountains which run eastward towards
Korat, and M’Lôm, and Thibet. Facing Mount
Khoc, other mountains rise abruptly from the right bank,
and then extend in an easterly direction.</p>

<p>As soon as my dwelling was finished, which was neither
a long nor a costly job, we slung up three hammocks, and
then betook ourselves to prepare a place for insect-catching,
the end of the rainy season being the best time
for this work. We accordingly cut down a great number
of trees, a hard and painful task in this climate, where
the sun, drawing up the humidity from all the surrounding
marshes, makes one feel as if in a stove or hothouse;
but our labours have been abundantly repaid by a rich
harvest of specimens. Beetles of the longicorn tribe
abound here; and to-day I have filled a box with more
than a thousand new or rare insects. I have even been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
fortunate enough to replace some of the more valuable
kinds which were destroyed or injured by sea-water on
board the ‘Sir James Brooke.’ The villagers come every
day to bring me “beasts,” as they call them, grasshoppers,
scorpions, serpents, tortoises, &amp;c., all presented
to me at the end of a stick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;">

<p class="caption">LAOTIAN HOUSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>The sanitary condition of the place is dreadful. The
rains are now less abundant, and the river has fallen more
than twenty feet. They tell me that at Boatioume it is so
narrow that the branches of the trees on the two banks
touch and form an arch overhead. The mountains are
of calcareous rock, and are covered with a fertile vegetation,
but everywhere bear the traces of the water which
anciently covered them. From the top you can imagine
the former limits of the ocean, and see that the plain to
the south was then submerged, and that all these heights
formed capes or islands. I found close to their base,
under a stratum of soil, banks of fossil coral and sea-shells
in a good state of preservation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HEAT DIMINISHED.</div>

<p>The north wind now makes itself frequently felt,
although the south-east and south-west winds resume their
sway at times, and bring back the rain; but the heat of
the nights gradually diminishes, and now, after three
o’clock in the morning, I can bear a covering, and am
glad to wrap myself in my burnous. My two men suffer
occasionally from attacks of intermittent fever, and often
complain of cold in the stomach; indeed, death lays so
many snares for us here, that he who escapes may think
himself lucky.</p>

<p>At last we breathe a pure and delicious air. It is
now mid winter; since the day before yesterday a fresh
north wind has blown, and at night the thermometer has
gone back to 18° centigrade. All the evening I have
been walking by the river, wrapped in a warm burnous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
with the hood up; and this is a pleasure I have not
enjoyed since I was at Phrabat, two years ago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PHRAI AND DENG.</div>

<p>One must have passed sleepless nights, suffocating with
the extreme heat, in order to appreciate the comfort of
sleeping under a woollen covering, and, above all, without
the necessity of waging incessant war on the dreadful
mosquitoes. Phrai and Deng wear their whole wardrobe
both night and day, and I have seen them dressed in red
flannel and with felt hats, when you might take them for
Garibaldians, as far, that is to say, as their costume is concerned,
for their appearance otherwise is far from warlike;
however, they are not wanting in a kind of courage
which has its own merit. They dance and sing round a
good fire, and open their eyes with astonishment when I
tell them that I have seen rivers larger than the Menam
frozen over so hard that the heaviest vehicles could go
upon them with safety,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and others on which whole
oxen have been roasted;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and that men and animals often
die of cold.</p>

<p>My little “Tine-Tine” says nothing, but creeps under
my counterpane and sleeps at his ease; only if Phrai
torments him by lifting the cover, he shows his teeth.
Ungrateful being that I am, I have not yet spoken of
this little companion who is so faithful and attached to
me&mdash;of this pretty “King Charles,” whom I brought from
home. All the Siamese, and especially those who have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
children, are very fond of the little creature, notwithstanding
their general aversion for dogs. Theirs, however,
are usually half savage. I much fear that my poor
dog will come to an untimely end, and be trampled under
foot by some elephant, or devoured at a mouthful by a
tiger.</p>

<p>For the last few days we have feasted; our provisions
were beginning to fail, but the fish are now coming up
the river, and we take them by hundreds. Certainly
they are not much larger than sardines, but in an hour
we took six or eight basketfuls, and my two boys have
enough to do to cut off their heads and salt them.</p>

<p>All the children of the neighbourhood, most of whom
are still kept at the breast, come frequently to bring me
insects, in exchange for a button or cigarette, for it is a
common thing for them to leave their mother’s breast to
smoke. Were they not so dirty, they would be nice-looking;
but I am afraid of touching them, lest I should
again catch the itch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAOTIAN SUPERSTITIONS.</div>

<p>The Laotian is as superstitious as the Cambodian, and
perhaps more so than the Siamese. If a person falls ill
of a fever, or, indeed, is ever so slightly indisposed, they
believe it to be owing to a demon who has entered his
body. If any matter in which they are engaged goes
wrong, or an accident happens when hunting, fishing, or
cutting wood, it is the fault of the demon. In their houses
they carefully preserve some object, generally a simple
piece of wood, or some parasitic plant, whose form they
fancy bears a resemblance to some part of the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
body; and this is constituted their household god, and
prevents evil spirits from entering, or, at least, causes
them speedily to depart.</p>

<p>Every day we go out on our collecting expeditions;
but while we are seeking insects or birds, the sound of our
voices, or the report of our guns, repeated by the mountain
echoes, brings forth the wild beasts from their dens.
Yesterday, after a long and fatiguing excursion, during
which we had killed some birds and one or two monkeys,
we were returning home quite worn out, when we reached
a small clearing in the forest, and here I told my two
boys<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to take a little repose at the foot of a tree, while I
went to hunt for insects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENCOUNTER WITH A TIGER.</div>

<p>Suddenly I heard a sound as of some animal gliding
through the thick underwood. I looked round, at the
same time loading my gun, and then crept quietly back
to the tree where my servants lay asleep, when I perceived
a large and beautiful leopard taking his spring to
clear the brushwood, and pounce upon one of them as he
lay all unconscious. I fired, the shot striking the animal
in the right shoulder. He gave a tremendous leap, and
rolled over among the bushes, which much embarrassed
his movements. However, he was but wounded, and still
dangerous, if my second ball did not kill, or at least
cripple him. I fired again, and hit him between the
shoulders; the ball lodged in the heart, and he fell dead
almost instantaneously. The terror of my two poor fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>lowers,
suddenly awakened by the report of my gun
so close to their ears, was only equalled by their pleasure
when they saw the creature extended lifeless before
them.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">THOUGHTS OF HOME.</div>

<p>Another year has flown, a year chequered for me, as
for others, with joy, anxiety, and trouble; and to-day my
thoughts turn especially to the few who are dear to me.
From more than one loving heart arise, I feel sure, on
this day, good wishes for the poor traveller, and from no
one more warmly than from you, my dear father. You
long for my return; so writes my brother in his last
letter, forwarded to me from Bangkok. But I am only
commencing my new campaign; would it be like a good
soldier to leave on the eve of the engagement? I am at
the gates of the infernal regions, for so the Laotians and
Siamese designate this forest, and I have no spell to
terrify the demons which inhabit it, neither tiger’s teeth
nor stunted stag-horn; nothing but my faith in and love
for God. If I must die here, where so many other wanderers
have left their bones, I shall be ready when my
hour comes.</p>

<p>The profound stillness of this forest, and its luxuriant
tropical vegetation, are indescribable, and at this midnight
hour impress me deeply. The sky is serene, the air
fresh, and the moon’s rays only penetrate here and there,
through the foliage, in patches, which appear on the
ground like pieces of white paper dispersed by the wind.
Nothing breaks the silence but a few dead leaves rustling
to the earth, the murmur of a brook which flows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
over its pebbly bed at my feet, and the frogs answering
each other on either side, and whose croaking resembles
the hoarse barking of a dog. Now and then I can distinguish
the flapping of the bats, attracted by the flame of
the torch which is fastened to a branch of the tree under
which my tiger-skin is spread; or, at longer intervals, the
cry of some panther calling to its mate, and responded
to from the tree-tops by the growling of the chimpanzees,
whose rest the sound has disturbed.</p>

<p>With a sabre in one hand and a torch in the other,
Phrai pursues the fishes in the stream, and he and his
shadow reflected on the rocks and water, as he stands
there making sudden darts, and crying out “hit” or
“missed,” might easily be mistaken by the natives for
demons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOREBODINGS.</div>

<p>I cannot shake off a feeling of sadness which a few
hours of sleep and a long chase to-morrow will probably
dissipate; yet, at the moment, I cannot forbear asking
myself, how will this year end for me? Shall I accomplish
all I have in view? shall I preserve that health without
which I can do nothing? and can I surmount all the
difficulties which oppose themselves to me, and of which
not the least is the difficulty of finding any means of
conveyance?</p>

<p>And you, my dear father, be not too anxious as to my
fate, but preserve that tranquillity, hope, and love of God,
which alone can make men strong and great: with this
help and support, our reunion will not be long delayed.
Courage then, and hope! our perseverance and efforts will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
be recompensed. And thou, invisible link, which, in spite
of distance, unites hearts, bear to all those dear to me a
thousand embraces, and fill them with all those thoughts
which at all times give me strength, and supply joy and
consolation in my saddest and most dreary hours. To
all, then, a happy new year! and may I bring back safe
and sound my poor young followers, who have been such
faithful and devoted companions; and who, although
already rather weakened by fever and incipient dysentery,
are still full of gaiety and energy, and as much
attached to me as ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NATURE OF THE COUNTRY.</div>

<p>Five or six leagues north of Khao-Khoc is Mount Sake,
and two miles farther all habitations cease, and there is
complete solitude as far as Boatioume. The banks become
more and more picturesque; here are calcareous
rocks, covered in places with a ferruginous crust, and
whence flow streams endowed with petrifying properties,
while hills, rising abruptly to a great height, contain
grottoes ornamented by stalactites; there, are beds of
sand, islands on which sport in the sun a crowd of iguanas;
everywhere, a rich vegetation, mingled with tufts of bamboo,
in which fight and squabble the chimpanzees, on
whom Phrai exercises his skill, and which afford him a
delicious repast.</p>

<p>We embarked in a very light pirogue, and, during the
first day, passed the boats from Petchaboune, which had
left Khao-Khoc the night before; for the current is still
rapid, even though the water is so low that in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
places you have to drag the boat over the sand, and poles
have to be used instead of oars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TIGERS NEAR BOATIOUME.</div>

<p>Tigers, which are rare at Khao-Khoc, are more common
in the environs of Boatioume, where they destroy many
of the cattle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot nobreak">

<p><span class="smcap">Town of Chaiapume&mdash;Journey to the Town of Korat&mdash;The
Province of Korat&mdash;Temple of Penom-Wat&mdash;Return to
Chaiapume&mdash;Poukiéau&mdash;Monang-Moune-Wa&mdash;Nam-Kane&mdash;Louang
Prabang, Capital of West Laos.</span></p></div>


<p>On the 28th February, 1863, I arrived at the town of
Chaiapume, and presented myself before the governor
to request his permission to hire some elephants or oxen
to enable me to continue my journey. I showed him my
French passport, and also gave him the letter from Khrom
Luang, and another from the Governor of Korat; but all
in vain. He replied that, if I wanted oxen or elephants,
there were plenty in the forest. I might easily have done
without the assistance of this functionary, and procured
animals from people in the village; but they would have
made me pay two or three times the ordinary price, and
my purse was too slenderly filled to allow of my submitting
to this extortion, which would probably be
repeated at every station.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO BANGKOK.</div>

<p>The only thing left me to do, therefore, was to retrace
my steps, and, leaving one of my servants at Korat with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
my baggage, to return to Bangkok and claim aid from the
consul, the ministers, or the king himself; for there is
a treaty between the Governments of Siam and France,
concluded by M. de Montigny, which obliges the king to
afford assistance and protection to the French, and especially
to missionaries and naturalists. It was a sad loss
of time for me, and might occasion me serious inconvenience;
for, if I were delayed, the rainy season might
surprise me in the midst of the forests before I could
reach a healthier region, and the consequences might be
fatal. However, I was forced to submit, and I returned
to Bangkok.</p>

<p>It cost me some time and trouble, and I found it
needful to make some valuable presents before I succeeded
in my object; but at last I obtained more
stringent letters to the governors of the provinces of Laos,
and left Bangkok once more, after having experienced
for a fortnight the kind hospitality of my friend Dr.
Campbell, one of the best men I ever met with: his
goodness, friendliness, and British frankness, won my
heart and my esteem.</p>

<p class="caption">BUILDING ERECTED AT THE FUNERAL OF THE QUEEN OF SIAM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After all this loss of time and great expense I went
again to Korat, where I was well received by the governor;
and he gave me, in addition to my other letters, one for
the mandarins of all provinces under his jurisdiction,
commanding them to furnish me with as many oxen and
elephants as I might require. The greater part of the
inhabitants, with Phrai at their head, came out to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
me, and several gave me presents&mdash;sacks of rice, fish,
fruits, or tobacco, all in abundance.</p>

<p>Speaking to me of his journey to Korat, Dr. House,
the most enterprising of the American missionaries at
Bangkok, and the only white man who has penetrated so
far for many years, told me that he found everything
disappointing. I could have said the same, if, like him,
I had started with any illusions; but I had a good idea
of the forest, which I had already passed at several points,
as at Phrabat, Khao Khoc, and Kenne Khoé, and amidst
whose deleterious shades I had already spent one night.
Nor did I expect to find towns amidst its thick and
almost impenetrable masses of foliage, through which
one can distinguish nothing beyond a distance of a few
feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOURNEY THROUGH THE FOREST.</div>

<p>I have lately again passed ten successive nights in this
forest. During our journey through it, all the Chinese
in the caravan, happy to find themselves still among the
living, at every halting-place hastened to draw from their
baskets an abundance of provisions wherewith to make
a comfortable repast: then choosing, for want of an altar,
some large tree, they laid out their dishes, lighted their
matches, burned a quantity of gilt paper, and, kneeling
down, murmured their prayers. Both on entering and
leaving the forest they erected a shed of leaves and sticks
interwoven, and raised upon four bamboo stakes, intended
as a sort of chapel, in which they placed a number of
offerings, in order, as they said, to drive away demons and
save them from death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the Laotians, I have found them, although
superstitious, very courageous, especially those who traverse
this forest eight or ten times a year. Some of them
even venture to awake the “King of Fire” by bringing
down game or shooting at robbers: yet death, even in
the best season, carries off one or two out of every ten
who travel here. I think the number of those who fall
victims to this terrible journey must be considerable in
the rainy season, when every torrent overflows its bounds;
the whole soil is soaked, the pathways nothing but bogs,
and the rice-grounds covered with several feet of water.
After five or six days’ walking through all this, with
feet in the mud, the body in a profuse perspiration, and
breathing a fetid atmosphere, hot as a stove and reeking
with putrid miasma, what wonder that many sink and
die?</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT KORAT.</div>

<p>Two Chinese in our caravan arrived at Korat in a
frightful state of fever. One I was able to save by
administering quinine in good time, but the other, who
appeared the strongest, was dead almost as soon as I heard
of his being ill.</p>

<p>We halted at five o’clock in the evening and encamped
on a little hill, where, in the absence of grass, our poor
oxen could only appease their hunger with leaves from
the shrubs. The river, which flows down from these hills,
is the same which runs near Korat, and on the opposite
bank was encamped another caravan with more than 200
oxen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRIBE OF KARIANS.</div>

<p>In a gorge of the mountain, and on the almost inac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>cessible
heights, I found a small tribe of Karians who
formerly inhabited the environs of Patawi, and who, for
the sake of preserving their independence, live here in
seclusion; for the dread of fever prevents the Siamese
from penetrating to their haunts. They have neither
temples nor priests; they raise magnificent crops of rice,
and cultivate several kinds of bananas, which are only
found among tribes of the same origin. Many of the
inhabitants of the neighbouring districts appear to be
ignorant of their very existence. It is true they are of
migratory habits; others say that they pay a tribute in
gum-lac, but the Governor of Korat and several chiefs
of the province of Saraburi, seemed to me profoundly
ignorant on the subject.</p>

<p>The following morning, an hour before sunrise, after
having counted the oxen dead from fatigue and exhaustion,
which would serve for food to the wild beasts,
and repacked our goods, we resumed our march. Towards
eleven o’clock, having quitted Dong Phya Phai, we
entered a long tract of ground filled with brushwood and
tall grass and swarming with deer, and here, before long,
we halted near a stream.</p>

<p>The next day, after making a détour of some miles to
the north to find a pass, we ascended a new chain of hills
running parallel to the last, and covered with blocks of
sandstone; and here the vegetation was extremely luxuriant.
The air was fresh and pure, and, thanks to
repeated ablutions in the running streams, those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
party whose feet had suffered most at the beginning of
the journey found them greatly improved.</p>

<p class="caption">BIVOUAC OF M. MOUHOT IN THE FORESTS OF LAOS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The monkeys and hornbills began to be heard again,
and I killed several pheasants and peacocks, and an eagle,
on which our guides feasted. Beyond these mountains
the soil becomes sandy again and vegetation scanty. We
encamped once more on the banks of the river of Korat,
300 metres from a village dignified by the name of chief
town of the district.</p>

<p>The last range of hills which we crossed still displays
itself like a sombre rampart, above which tower the
dome-like and pyramidal summits of others farther in the
distance.</p>

<p>Our guides are all Laotians from the neighbourhood
of Korat, and their leader is unremitting in his care and
attention towards me. Every evening he prepares my
place for the night, levelling the ground and cutting down
branches which he covers with leaves, and I am thus
raised from the earth and protected from the dew. These
guides lead a hard life, tramping in all seasons along
these wretched roads, having scarcely time, morning and
evening, to swallow a little rice, and having but little
sleep at nights, tormented by ants, and exposed to the
attacks of robbers, against whom they have constantly to
be on their guard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROVINCE OF KORAT.</div>

<p>Every day we met one or two caravans of from eighty
to a hundred oxen, laden with stag and panther skins,
raw silk from Laos, <i>langoutis</i> of cotton and silk, peacocks’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
tails, ivory, elephants’ bones, and sugar; but this latter
article is scarce.</p>

<p>The country presented much the same kind of aspect
for four days after leaving the forest. We passed through
several considerable villages, in one of which, Sikiéou,
are kept six hundred oxen belonging to the king. The
journey from Keng-Koë to Korat occupied ten days.
The Chinese quarter of this latter town contains sixty or
seventy houses, built with bricks dried in the sun, and
surrounded by palisades nine feet high, and as strong as
those of a rampart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOWN OF KORAT.</div>

<p>These precautions are very necessary, for Korat is a nest
of robbers and assassins, the resort of all the scum of
the Laotian and Siamese races. Bandits and vagrants,
escaped from slavery or from prison, gather here like the
vultures and wolves which follow armies and caravans.
It is not that they enjoy complete immunity, for the
governor, son of Bodine, the general who conquered
Battambong and the revolted provinces, is viceroy of the
state, has absolute power of life and death, and is, they
say, very severe, cutting off a head or a hand with little
compunction. But still it is Siamese justice, “non
inviola:” there are neither gendarmes nor police; the
person robbed must himself arrest the offender and bring
him before the judge. Even his neighbour will give no
assistance in the capture.</p>

<p>It was necessary to look out for a dwelling, and I
applied to the Chinese, hoping to find a house rather
larger than the one where Phrai had settled himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
with my luggage, and I had not much difficulty in
doing so.</p>

<p>At the end of the Chinese quarter, which is the bazaar,
commences the town properly so called, which is enclosed
by a wall of ferruginous stone and sandstone, brought
from the distant mountain&mdash;a work which I at once recognised
as that of the Khmerdôm. Within is the residence
of the governor and those of the other authorities, several
pagodas, a caravanserai, and a number of other houses.
A stream of water, eight metres wide, crosses the town
and is bordered by little plantations of betel and cocoa-nut
trees.</p>

<p>The real town of Korat does not contain more than
five or six thousand inhabitants, including six hundred
Chinese. The Siamese I found impertinent and disagreeable,
the Chinese friendly and kind. It was the contrast
between civilization and barbarism&mdash;between the mass of
vices engendered by idleness, and the good qualities cultivated
by habits of industry. Unfortunately, however,
the money acquired by these indefatigable merchants
furnishes the means of gratifying their baneful propensities,
gambling and opium-smoking.</p>

<p>Stretched on a carpet in some shed they lie, thin and
emaciated-looking, playing at cards, or else, plunged in
a kind of lethargy, they surrender themselves to the
influence of the seductive drug in their dark and filthy
hovels, lighted only by a single lamp. Yet, in spite of
their gambling, most of them grow rich, though they
generally begin poor, and with goods lent to them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
some countryman from his shop, and a few voyages frequently
suffice to make their fortunes.</p>

<p>The merchants who bring silk, which, though of
inferior quality, is an important article of commerce,
come from Laos, Oubone, Bassac, and Jasoutone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONDITION OF THE PROVINCE.</div>

<p>The entire province of Korat comprises a number of
villages, and more than eleven towns, some containing
as many as fifty or sixty thousand inhabitants. This little
state is simply tributary, but on condition of furnishing
the first and most considerable levy of men in case
of war.</p>

<p>The tribute consists of gold or silver, and in several
districts, amongst others those of Chaiapume and Poukiéan,
amounts to eight ticals a head. Some pay in
silk, which is weighed by the mandarins, who, as with
the cardamom at Pursat, and the <i>langoutis</i> at Battambong,
buy a further quantity on their own account, and at their
own price.</p>

<p>Elephants are numerous, and a great many are brought
from the north of Laos as far as Muang-Lang. I should
think there must be more than a thousand of these
animals in each province. Oxen and buffaloes were
formerly exceedingly cheap, but the distemper, which
has for some years committed great ravages among the
herds, has doubled or tripled the price. They are brought
southward from the extreme north of East Laos, and even
from the frontiers of Tonquin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PENOM-WAT.</div>

<p>I went to see a temple nine miles east of Korat, called
Penom-Wat. It is very remarkable, although much in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>ferior
in grandeur and beauty to those of Ongcor. The
second governor lent me a pony and guide, and, after
crossing extensive rice plantations, under a vertical and
fiery sun, we reached the spot to which my curiosity
had attracted me, and which, like an oasis, could be recognised
a long way off by the freshness of its cocoa-trees
and its rich verdure. I did not arrive there, however,
without having taken an involuntary bath. In crossing
the Tekon, which is nearly four feet deep, I, in order to
escape a wetting, tried to imitate Franconi, by standing
on my saddle; but, unluckily, according to the custom
of the country, this was fastened on by two pieces of
string, and in the middle of the stream it turned and
sent me head foremost into the water. But there was
no worse result from the accident than my having to
remain for half an hour afterwards dressed in Siamese
fashion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="nobreak"><p class="attribution">Drawn by M. Catenacci, from a Sketch by M. Mouhot.</p>

<p class="caption">RUINS AT PAN BRANG, CHAIAPUME.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Penom-Wat is an interesting temple 36 metres long by
40 wide, and the plan resembles a cross with tolerable
exactness. It is composed of two pavilions, with vaulted
stone roofs and elegant porticoes. The roofs are from
seven to eight metres in height, the gallery three metres
wide in the interior, and the walls a metre thick. At each
façade of the gallery are two windows with twisted bars.</p>

<p>This temple is built of red and grey sandstone, coarse
in the grain, and in some places beginning to decay. On
one of the doors is a long inscription, and above are
sculptures representing nearly the same subjects as those
at Ongcor and Bassette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>In one of the pavilions are several Buddhist idols in
stone, the largest of which is 2 metres 50 centimetres
high, and actually covered with rags.</p>

<p>You might here easily imagine yourself among the
ruins of Ongcor. There is the same style of architecture,
the same taste displayed, the same immense blocks
polished like marble, and so beautifully fitted together,
that I can only compare it to the joining and planing of
so many planks.</p>

<p>The whole building is, without doubt, the work of the
Khmerdôm, and not an imitation, and must be as old as
the illustrious reigns which have left the traces of their
grandeur in different parts of the empire. The exterior
is not equal to the interior. Penom was the temple
of the Queen, so say the Siamese; that of the King,
her husband, is at Pimaïe, a district about 30 miles east
of Korat.</p>

<p>To consult any existing maps of Indo-China for my
guidance in the interior of Laos would have been a folly,
no traveller, at least to my knowledge, having penetrated
into east Laos, or published any authentic information
respecting it. To question the natives about places more
than a degree distant would have been useless. My
desire was to reach Louang-Prabang by land, to visit the
northern tribes dependent on that state, and then again
to descend the Mekong to Cambodia. Setting out from
Korat, I had but to proceed northwards as long as I
found practicable roads and inhabited places; and if
I could not go by a direct route to Louang-Prabang, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
should only have to diverge to the east when I judged it
necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO CHAIAPUME.</div>

<p>I was again delayed a few days at Korat before I
could obtain elephants, in consequence of the absence of
the viceroy; but on his return he received me in a
friendly manner, and gave me a letter of introduction to
the governors of the provinces under his jurisdiction. He
likewise furnished me with two elephants for myself and
servants, and two others for my baggage; so at last I
was able to set out for Chaiapume. Before I started,
the Chinese with whom I lodged gave me the following
advice:&mdash;“Buy a tam-tam, and, wherever you halt,
sound it. They will say, ‘Here is an officer of the king;’
robbers will keep aloof, and the authorities will respect
you. If this does not answer, the only plan to get rid
of all the difficulties which the Laotian officials will be
sure to throw in your way is to have a good stick, the
longer the better. Try it on the back of any mandarin
who makes the least resistance and will not do what you
wish. Put all delicacy aside. Laos is not like a country
of the whites. Follow my advice, and you will find it
good.”</p>

<p>I was, however, much better received on my second visit
to Chaiapume, and required neither tam-tam nor cane.
The sight of the elephants and the order from the viceroy
of Korat made the mandarin as supple as a glove, and
he provided me with other elephants for a visit to some
ruins existing about 3 leagues north of the town, at the
foot of a mountain. The superstitious Laotians say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
these ruins contain gold, but that every one who has
sought for it has been struck with madness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOURNEY TO POUKIEAN.</div>

<p>Two roads lead from Chaiapume to Poukiéan; the first,
across the mountains, is so excessively difficult, that I
decided on taking the other, which, however, is much
longer. The first day we started at 1 o’clock, and reached
a village named Non Jasiea, where we were overtaken by
a fearful storm. We sheltered ourselves as well as we
could, and arrived before night at the entrance of a forest
where we slept.</p>

<p>For five days we were compelled to remain in the
forest on account of the weather; it rained great part
of the day, and throughout the night; the torrents overflowed,
and the earth was nothing but a sea of mud.
I never in my life passed such wretched nights, as all
the time we had to remain with our wet clothes on our
backs, and I cannot describe what we suffered. The
snow hurricanes, so frequent in Russia, and which nearly
killed me when in that country, seemed trifling miseries
in comparison. My poor Phrai was seized with a dreadful
fever two days before reaching Poukiéan, and I myself
felt very ill.</p>

<p>The passage of the mountains was easy, and the ascent
very gradual; blocks of stone obstruct the road in
various parts, but our oxen and elephants made their way
without much difficulty. I had bought a horse for myself
at Korat.</p>

<p>The vegetation, though not thick, is beautiful: the
trees, many of which are resinous, are slender, the stems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
being seldom more than a foot or two in diameter, and
often 25, 30, and even 40 metres in height. Under their
shade are to be seen great numbers of deer, and tigers
are not uncommonly met with. In the mountains are
many elephants and rhinoceros. We found immense beds
of stone, and in some places saw small brick buildings
containing idols. During the journey one of my chests
was thrown to the ground by the movements of the
elephant, and broken to pieces, as, unfortunately, were
all the contents, consisting of instruments, and bottles of
spirit of wine containing serpents and fishes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POUKIEAN.</div>

<p>Poukiéan is a smaller village than Chaiapume. I met
with a friendly reception from the governor, who had
just returned from Korat, and had heard of my intended
journey. Poverty and misery reign here; we cannot find
even a fish to purchase; nothing but rice; and as soon
as my faithful Phrai is on his legs again we shall leave
the place.</p>

<p>Tine-Tine attracts the most attention. The people
do not, as we pass, cry out first, “Look at the white
stranger,” but “A little dog!” and every one runs to see
this curiosity. My turn comes afterwards.</p>

<p>In these mountains the Laotians make offerings to
the local genii of sticks and stones.</p>

<p>The same chain of hills which, from the banks of
the Menam, in the province of Saraburi, extends on one
side to the southern extremity of the peninsula, on the
other encircles Cambodia like a belt, runs along the
shores of the gulf, and forms a hundred islands; stretches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
directly northwards, continually increasing in size, and
spreading its ramifications towards the east, where they
form a hundred narrow valleys, the streams flowing
through which empty themselves into the Mekong.</p>

<p>The rains had commenced on my second entrance
into Dong Phya Phai, and I was greeted by a perfect
deluge, which continued with intervals of two or three
days; but this did not stop me, although I had to pass
through a country still more to be dreaded than this
forest, and where no one goes willingly.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE ELEPHANT.</div>

<p>In all this mountainous region elephants are the
only means of transport. Every village possesses some,
several as many as fifty or a hundred. Without this
intelligent animal no communication would be possible
during seven months of the year, while, with his assistance,
there is scarcely a place to which you cannot
penetrate.</p>

<p>The elephant ought to be seen on these roads, which
I can only call devil’s pathways, and are nothing but
ravines, ruts two or three feet deep, full of mud; sometimes
sliding with his feet close together on the wet clay
of the steep slopes, sometimes half buried in mire, an
instant afterwards mounted on sharp rocks, where one
would think a Blondin alone could stand; striding
across enormous trunks of fallen trees, crushing down the
smaller trees and bamboos which oppose his progress, or
lying down flat on his stomach that the cornacs (drivers)
may the easier place the saddle on his back; a hundred
times a day making his way, without injuring them, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>tween
trees where there is barely room to pass; sounding
with his trunk the depth of the water in the streams or
marshes; constantly kneeling down and rising again, and
never making a false step. It is necessary, I repeat, to
see him at work like this in his own country, to form
any idea of his intelligence, docility, and strength, or how
all those wonderful joints of his are adapted to their
work&mdash;fully to understand that this colossus is no rough
specimen of nature’s handiwork, but a creature of especial
amiability and sagacity, designed for the service of
man.</p>

<p>We must not, however, exaggerate his merits. Probably
the saddles used by the Laotians are capable of
great improvement; but I must admit that the load of
three small oxen, that is to say, about 250 or 300 pounds,
is all that I ever saw the largest elephants carry easily,
and 18 miles is the longest distance they can accomplish
with an ordinary load. Ten or twelve miles are the
usual day’s work. With four, five, or sometimes seven
elephants, I travelled over all the mountain country from
the borders of Laos to Louang-Prabang, a distance of
nearly 500 miles.</p>

<p class="caption">CARAVAN OF ELEPHANTS CROSSING THE MOUNTAINS OF LAOS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>All this eastern portion, with the exception of a few
villages filled with “black-bellied savages”&mdash;so called
from the manner in which they tattoo themselves&mdash;is
inhabited by the same race, the “white-bellied Laotians,”
who call themselves Laos, and are known by this
name to all the Siamese, Chinese, and surrounding
nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">WESTERN LAOTIANS.</div>

<p>The black-bellied or western Laotians are called by
their eastern brethren by the same name which, in Siam
and Cambodia, is bestowed on the Annamites, Zuène,
Lao-Zuène. The only thing that distinguishes them is,
that they tattoo the under part of the body, principally
the thighs, and frequently wear the hair long and knotted
on the top of their heads. Their language is nearly
the same, and differs little from the Siamese and Eastern
Laos, except in the pronunciation, and in certain expressions
no longer in use among the former.</p>

<p>I soon found that, but for the letter from the governor
of Korat, I should have met everywhere with the same
reception as at Chaiapume; however, this missive was
very positively worded. Wherever I went, the authorities
were ordered to furnish me with elephants, and supply
me with all necessary provisions, as if I were a king’s
envoy. I was much amused to see these petty provincial
chiefs executing the orders of my servants, and evidently
in dread lest, following the Siamese custom, I should use
the stick.</p>

<p>One of my men, to give himself importance, had tied
one of these bugbears to the arms which he carried, and
the sight of it alone sufficed, with the sound of the tam-tam,
to inspire fear, whilst small presents judiciously
distributed, and a little money to the cornacs, procured
me the sympathy of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUFFERINGS OF TRAVELLERS.</div>

<p>Most of the villages are situated about a day’s journey
from one another, but frequently you have to travel for
three or four days without seeing a single habitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and then you have no alternative but to sleep in the
jungle. This might be pleasant in the dry season, but,
during the rains, nothing can give an idea of the sufferings
of travellers at night, under a miserable shelter of leaves
hastily spread over a rough framework of branches,
assaulted by myriads of mosquitoes attracted by the light
of the fires and torches, by legions of ox-flies, which, after
sunset, attack human beings as well as elephants, and by
fleas so minute as to be almost invisible, which assemble
about you in swarms, and whose bites are excessively
painful, and raise enormous blisters.</p>

<p>To these enemies add the leeches, which, after the
least rain, come out of the ground, scent a man twenty
feet off, and hasten to suck his blood with wonderful
avidity. To coat your legs with a layer of lime when
travelling is the only way to prevent them covering your
whole body.</p>

<p>I had left Bangkok on the 12th of April, and on
the 16th of May I reached Leuye, the chief town of a
district belonging to two provinces, Petchaboune and
Lôme. It is situated in a narrow valley, like all the
towns and villages through which I have passed since I
left Chaiapume.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">“PARK” OF ELEPHANTS, EXTERNAL VIEW.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">MINERALS.</div>

<p>This is the district of Siam richest in minerals; one
of its mountains contains immense beds of magnetic iron
of a remarkably good quality. Others yield antimony,
argentiferous copper, and tin. The iron only is worked,
and this population, half agriculturists, half artisans,
furnish spades and cutlasses to all the surrounding pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>vinces,
even beyond Korat. Yet they have neither
foundries nor steam-engines, and it is curious to see how
little it costs an iron-worker to establish himself in a
hole about a yard and a half square hollowed out close
to the mountain.</p>

<p>They pile up and smelt the mineral with charcoal:
the liquified iron deposits itself in the bottom of the
cavity, and there hollows out a bed, whence they withdraw
it when the operation is completed, and carry it
home. There, in another cavity they make a fire, which
a child keeps alive by means of a couple of bellows,
which are simply two trunks of hollow trees buried in
the ground, and upon which play alternately two stopples
surrounded by cotton. These are fixed to a small board,
and have long sticks for handles, to which are attached
two bamboo hollow canes which conduct the air into the
cavity.</p>

<p>In several localities I discovered auriferous sand, but
only in small quantity. In some of the villages the inhabitants
employ their leisure time in searching for gold,
but they told me that they hardly gained by this work
sufficient to pay for the rice they ate.</p>

<p>In this journey I have passed through sixty villages,
numbering from twenty to fifty houses each; and six
small towns, with a population of from four to six hundred
inhabitants. I have made a map of all this part of the
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RIVERS.</div>

<p>Since leaving Korat I have crossed five large rivers
which fall into the Mekon, the bed of which is more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
less full according to the season. The first of these, 35
metres wide, is called the Menam Chie, lat. 15° 45′;
second, the Menam Leuye, 90 metres wide, lat. 18° 3′;
third, the Menam Ouan, at Kenne-Tao, 100 metres in
width, lat. 18° 35′; fourth, the Nam Pouye, 60 metres,
lat. 19°; fifth, the Nam-Houn, 80 or 100 metres wide,
lat. 20°.</p>

<p>The Chie is navigable, as far up as the latitude of
Korat, from May to December; the Leuye, the Ouan, and
the Houn are only navigable for a very short distance
on account of their numerous rapids; neither is there
any water-communication between the Menam and the
Mekon in Laos or Cambodia, the mountains which
separate them forming insurmountable obstacles to cutting
canals.</p>

<p>The Laotians much resemble the Siamese: a different
pronunciation and slow manner of speech being all that
distinguishes their language. The women wear petticoats,
and keep their hair long, which, when combed, gives the
younger ones a more interesting appearance than those
have who live on the banks of the Menam; but, at an
advanced age, with their unkempt locks thrown negligently
over one temple, and their immense goîtres, which they
admire, they are repulsively ugly.</p>

<p class="caption">LAOTIAN GIRLS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Little commerce is carried on in this part of Laos.
The Chinese inhabiting Siam do not come as far, owing
to the enormous expense of transporting all their merchandise
on elephants. Nearly every year a caravan
arrives from Yunnan and Quangsee, composed of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
a hundred persons and several hundred mules. Some
go to Kenne Thao, others to M. Nâne and Chieng
Maï. They arrive in February, and leave in March or
April.</p>

<p>The mulberry does not thrive in these mountains;
but in some localities this tree is cultivated for the sake
of furnishing food to a particular insect which lives upon
its leaves, and from which is obtained the lague or Chinese
varnish.</p>

<p>All the gum-benzoin which is sold at Bangkok comes
from the northern extremity of the state of Louang
Prabang, and from a district tributary both to Cochin
China and Siam, and peopled rather by Tonquinites than
Laotians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAKLAIE&mdash;THE MEKON.</div>

<p>On the 24th of June I arrived at Paklaïe, lat.
19° 16′ 58″, the first small town on my northward
route. It is situated on the Mekon, and is a charming
place; the inhabitants seem well off; the houses elegant
and spacious,&mdash;larger, indeed, than I have seen before
in this country; and everything betokens a degree of
prosperity which I have also remarked wherever I have
stopped since. The Mekon at this place is much larger
than the Menam at Bangkok, and forces its way between
the lofty mountains with a noise resembling the roaring
of the sea and the impetuosity of a torrent, seeming
scarcely able to keep within its bed. There are many
rapids between Paklaïe and Louang Prabang, which is ten
or fifteen days’ painful travelling.</p>

<p>I was tired of my long journey on elephants, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
anxious to hire a boat here, but the chief and some of
the inhabitants, fearing that I might meet with some
accident, advised me to continue my route by land. I
therefore proceeded as far as Thadua, ninety miles farther
north, and during eight days passed through much
the same style of country as before, changing one valley
for another, and crossing mountains which became more
and more elevated, and being more than ever annoyed
by the leeches. We were, however, no longer compelled
to sleep in the jungle, for every evening we reached some
hamlet or village, where we found shelter either in a
pagoda or caravanserai.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PREVALENCE OF GOÎTRE.</div>

<p>As among the Grisons or the mountains of the Valais,
the whole population, from Dong Phya Phai to this
district, who drink the water of the mountain rivulets,
are disfigured by immense goîtres; but the men are not
so subject to them as the women, who rarely escape.</p>

<p>I have only passed through one village where any
serious ravages are committed by the tigers. There is
one danger, which may be serious, incident to travelling
with elephants in a region like this. Usually, among
the caravan there are one or two females, followed by
their young, who run about from one side to another,
playing or browsing. Now and then one of them stumbles
and falls into a ravine, and immediately the whole troop
jump down after him to draw him out.</p>

<p>In a letter which I wrote from Cambodia I described
the Mekon river as imposing, but monotonous and unpicturesque;
but in this part of the country it presents a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
very different appearance. Where it is narrowest the
width is above 1000 metres, and it everywhere runs
between lofty mountains, down whose sides flow torrents,
all bringing their tribute. There is almost an excess of
grandeur. The eye rests constantly on these mountain
slopes, clothed in the richest and thickest verdure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOUANG PRABANG.</div>

<p>On the 25th of July I reached Louang Prabang, a
delightful little town, covering a square mile of ground,
and containing a population, not, as Mgr. Pallegoix says
in his work on Siam, of 80,000, but of 7000 or 8000 only.
The situation is very pleasant. The mountains which,
above and below this town, enclose the Mekon, form here
a kind of circular valley or amphitheatre, nine miles in
diameter, and which, there can be no doubt, was anciently
a lake. It was a charming picture, reminding one of the
beautiful lakes of Como and Geneva. Were it not for
the constant blaze of a tropical sun, or if the mid-day heat
were tempered by a gentle breeze, the place would be a
little paradise.</p>

<p>The town is built on both banks of the stream, though
the greater number of the houses are built on the left
bank. The most considerable part of the town surrounds
an isolated mount, more than a hundred metres in height,
at the top of which is a pagoda.</p>

<p>Were they not restrained by fear of the Siamese, and
their horror of the jungles so prolific of death, this principality
would soon fall into the hands of the Annamites,
who now dare not advance nearer than seven days’
journey off. A beautiful stream, 100 metres wide, unites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with the great river to the north-east of the town, and
leads to some Laotian and savage villages bearing the
name of <i>Fie</i>. These are no other than the tribes called
<i>Penoms</i> by the Cambodians, <i>Khu</i> by the Siamese, and
<i>Moï</i> by the Annamites,&mdash;all words simply signifying
“savages.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNTAIN TRIBES.</div>

<p>The whole chain of mountains which extends from
the north of Tonquin to the south of Cochin China,
about 100 miles north of Saigon, is inhabited by this
primitive people, divided into tribes speaking different
dialects, but whose manners and customs are the same.
All the villages in the immediate neighbourhood are
tributary; those nearest to the town supply workmen for
buildings erected for the king and princes, and these are
heavily taxed. Others pay their tribute in rice.</p>

<p>Their habitations are in the thickest parts of the
forests, where they only can find a path. Their cultivated
grounds are to be seen on the tops and sides of the
mountains; in fact, they employ the same means as wild
animals to escape from their enemies, and to preserve
that liberty and independence which are to them, as to
all God’s creatures, their supreme good.</p>

<p>Yesterday, and the day previous, I was presented to
the princes who govern this little state, and who bear
the title of kings. I know not why, but they displayed
for my benefit all they could devise of pomp and
splendour.</p>

<p>The Laotians of Leuye appear to me more industrious
than the Siamese, and, above all, possess a much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
adventurous and mercantile spirit; and although, both
physically and morally, there are great points of resemblance,
yet there exist shades of difference which distinguish
them at once, and are apparent in their dialect,
or rather patois, and in their manners, which are more
simple and affable. They are all much alike in features;
the women have round faces, small noses, large almond-shaped
eyes, thick hair, the mouth large and strongly-marked;
but the men do not exhibit so great a diversity
of race as they do in Siam.</p>

<p>Alas! what a journey my fragile collection of specimens,
so difficult to gather together, has still to take,
and what various accidents may befall them! Those who
in museums contemplate the works of Nature do not
think of all the perseverance, trouble, and anxiety required
before they are safely brought home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LAOTIANS.</div>

<p>The Laotians have not the curiosity of the Siamese,
and ask me fewer questions. I find them more intelligent
than either the latter race or the Cambodians, and
among the villagers especially there is a curious mixture
of cunning and simplicity. They do not as yet seem to
me to merit their reputation for hospitality,&mdash;a virtue
which appeared to be much more practised in Siam. I
should never have obtained any means of conveyance
without the letter from the Viceroy of Korat, and my
experience has been that they are less respectful, but at
the same time less importunate, than the Siamese.</p>

<p>The ground between Leuye and Kenne Thao is hilly,
but traversed without difficulty. The formations are cal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>careous
rocks, sandstone, slaty sandstone, and lime mixed
with clay; the sandstone in long beds, not in blocks.
In the streams I found stones, not boulders, but with sharp
angles.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Indians alone traffic here; it requires
a day’s journey to conclude the smallest bargain, and a
whole village is assembled to make sure that the money
is not spurious. On my route here I have not met a
single Siamese, but in every village have seen Birmans,
Kariens, and people from Western Laos. I have found
men in Lao-Pouene moulded like athletes and of herculean
strength, and thought that the King of Siam might
raise in this province a fine regiment of grenadiers. In
all the villages I have visited, the inhabitants, including
even the priests, set to work to collect insects for me, glad
to receive in return a few copper buttons, glass beads, or a
little red cloth.</p>

<p>At Paklaïe, which I have already mentioned as a
pretty town, I had the pleasure of again seeing the beautiful
stream, which now seems to me like an old friend:
I have so long drunk of its waters, it has so long either
cradled me on its bosom or tried my patience, at one
time flowing majestically among the mountains, at another
muddy and yellow as the Arno at Florence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROAD FROM KENNE THAO TO PAKLAÏE.</div>

<p>The road between Kenne Thao and Paklaïe is dreadful.
You have to force your way along a narrow path, through
a thick jungle, and sometimes there is no path at all, or
else it is obstructed by bamboos and branches which
interlace and often catch hold of your saddle. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
moment you are in danger of being hurt by them; our
hands and faces were covered with scratches, and my
clothes torn to pieces.</p>

<p>Muang-Moune-Wa.&mdash;This place is surrounded by mountains.
I am very feverish and tremble with cold, although
the thermometer shows 80 degrees of heat. I am
getting tired of these people, a race of children, heartless
and unenergetic. I sigh and look everywhere for
a man, and cannot find one; here all tremble at the
stick, and the enervating climate makes them incredibly
apathetic.</p>

<p>15th August, 1861.&mdash;Nam Kane. A splendid night;
the moon shines with extraordinary brilliancy, silvering
the surface of this lovely river, bordered by high mountains,
looking like a grand and gloomy rampart. The
chirp of the crickets alone breaks the stillness. In my
little cottage all is calm and tranquil; the view from
my window is charming, but I cannot appreciate or
enjoy it. I am sad and anxious; I long for my native
land, for a little life; to be always alone weighs on my
spirits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOUANG PRABANG.</div>

<p>Louang Prabang, 29th August, 1861.&mdash;My third servant,
Song, whom I had engaged at Pakpriau, begged me to
allow him to return to Bangkok in the suite of the Prince
of Louang Prabang, who was going there to pay tribute.
I did all I could to induce him to remain with me, but
he seemed to have made up his mind to go; so I paid
him his wages, and gave him a letter authorising him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
receive a further sum at Bangkok for the time occupied
by his return journey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE OF SONG.</div>

<p>Same date. Song is gone. How changeable we are!
He was always complaining of cold or had some other
grievance, and I cared less for him than for my other
servants&mdash;but then I had not had him long. Yesterday,
however, when he asked permission to go, I was vexed.
Either he has really suffered much here from illness, or
has not been happy with me; perhaps both. I hired a
boat to take him to the town, and my good Phrai accompanied
him there this morning, and recommended him
from me to a mandarin whom I knew. I gave him all
that was necessary for his journey, even if it lasts three
months, and on his arrival at Bangkok he will receive
his money. On taking leave he prostrated himself before
me; I took hold of his hands and raised him up, and then
he burst into tears. And I, in my turn, when I had bid
him farewell, felt my eyes fill, nor do I know when I
shall be quite calm, for I have before me, day and night,
the poor lad, ill in the woods, among indifferent or cruel
people. He has a great dread of fever, and, if he had
been taken ill here and died, I should have reproached
myself for keeping him; and yet, if it were to come over
again, I almost fancy I would not yield to his desire to
leave me. He was confided to me by the good Father
Larmandy. May God protect the poor boy, and preserve
him from all sickness and accidents during his
journey!</p>

<p>The dress of the Laotians differs little from that of the
Siamese. The people wear the <i>langouti</i> and a little red
cotton waistcoat, or often nothing at all. Both men and
women go barefoot: their head-dresses are like the
Siamese. The women are generally better-looking than
those of the latter nation: they wear a single short
petticoat of cotton, and sometimes a piece of silk over
the breast. Their hair, which is black, they twist into a
knot at the back of the head. The houses are built of
bamboos and leaves interwoven and raised upon stakes,
and underneath is a shelter for domestic animals, such
as oxen, pigs, fowls, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The dwellings are, in the strictest sense, unfurnished,
having neither tables nor beds, nor, with few exceptions,
even vessels of earth or porcelain. They eat their
rice made into balls out of their hands, or from little
baskets plaited with cane, some of which are far from
unartistic.</p>

<p>The crossbow and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sarbacane</i> are the arms used in
hunting, as well as a kind of lance made of bamboo, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
sometimes, but more rarely, the gun, with which they are
very skilful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RHINOCEROS-HUNT.</div>

<p>In the hamlet of Na-Lê, where I had the pleasure of
killing a female tiger, which with its partner was committing
great ravages in the neighbourhood, the chief
hunter of the village got up a rhinoceros-hunt in my
honour. I had not met with this animal in all my
wanderings through the forests. The manner in which
he is hunted by the Laotians is curious on account of
its simplicity and the skill they display. Our party
consisted of eight, including myself. I and my servants
were armed with guns, and at the end of mine was a
sharp bayonet. The Laotians had bamboos with iron
blades something between a bayonet and a poignard. The
weapon of the chief was the horn of a sword-fish, long,
sharp, strong, and supple, and not likely to break.</p>

<p>Thus armed, we set off into the thickest part of the
forest, with all the windings of which our leader was well
acquainted, and could tell with tolerable certainty where
we should find our expected prey. After penetrating
nearly two miles into the forest, we suddenly heard the
crackling of branches and rustling of the dry leaves.
The chief went on in advance, signing to us to keep a
little way behind, but to have our arms in readiness.
Soon our leader uttered a shrill cry as a token that the
animal was near; he then commenced striking against
each other two bamboo canes, and the men set up wild
yells to provoke the animal to quit his retreat.</p>

<p>A few minutes only elapsed before he rushed towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
us, furious at having been disturbed. He was a rhinoceros
of the largest size, and opened a most enormous mouth.
Without any signs of fear, but, on the contrary, of great
exultation, as though sure of his prey, the intrepid hunter
advanced, lance in hand, and then stood still, waiting
for the creature’s assault. I must say I trembled for him,
and I loaded my gun with two balls; but when the
rhinoceros came within reach and opened his immense
jaws to seize his enemy, the hunter thrust the lance into
him to a depth of some feet, and calmly retired to where
we were posted.</p>

<p>The animal uttered fearful cries and rolled over on his
back in dreadful convulsions, while all the men shouted
with delight. In a few minutes more we drew nearer to
him; he was vomiting pools of blood. I shook the chief’s
hand in testimony of my satisfaction at his courage and
skill. He told me that to myself was reserved the honour
of finishing the animal, which I did by piercing his throat
with my bayonet, and he almost immediately yielded up
his last sigh. The hunter then drew out his lance and
presented it to me as a souvenir; and in return I gave
him a magnificent European poignard.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">DIRECTIONS AND DISTANCES.</div>

<p>Oubon and Bassac lie W.N.W. from M. Pimaï. It
takes eight days in the rainy season to travel from this
last town to Oubon, two more to reach Bassac. To
return occupies at least double that period, the current
being excessively strong.</p>

<p>The Ménam-Moune at Pimaï is 75 metres wide in the
dry season; in the rainy season it is from 6 to 7 metres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
in depth. There are in this district iron, lignites, and
trunks of petrified trees lying on the ground, which even
from a very short distance look like fallen trees in a
natural state.</p>

<p>Mgi-Poukham, inhabited by the Soués, is six days’
journey from Korat in a south-easterly direction.</p>

<p>In the dry season the navigation of the river is impeded
by sandbanks: at some points the stream is tolerably
wide, but in others choked with sand.</p>

<p>From Korat to Pimaï, on an elephant, occupies two
days: from Korat to Thaison, two; to Sisapoune, two; to
Josoutone, two days; to Oubon, four days; to Bassac,
four.</p>

<p>Direction E.N.E. from Korat; Poukiéau, N. of Chaiapume;
Pouvienne, ten degrees E. of Chaiapume; Dong-kaïe,
N.E. by E. of Chaiapume; M. Louang Prabang, N.
of Chaiapume.</p>

<p>From Chaiapume to Vien-Tiane is fifteen days’ journey
on foot towards the N. and nine degrees E. M. Lôm,
N.W. of Chaiapume; Petchaboune, W.N.W. of Chaiapume;
Bassac, E.S.E.</p>

<p>Bane Prom, a mountain situated in a valley nine miles
across, is nearly 300 metres high. Bane Prom, a town.
Menam Prom, a river nearly 2 metres deep and 40
wide, rises in M’Lôm, and empties itself in the Menam
Chie, in the province of Koukhine. Bane-Rike, between
Poukiéau and Kone-Sane, four geographical leagues from
each place. Menam-Rike is a torrent which empties itself
into the Prom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>The vegetation is monotonous&mdash;everywhere resinous
trees, chiefly of small size. There is a complete absence
of birds; insects are in great number and variety, musquitoes
and ox-flies in myriads. I suffer dreadfully from
them, and am covered with swellings and blisters from
their bites; and they torment our beasts so much that
we sometimes fear it will drive them mad. The sensibility
of the skin of the elephant is extraordinary, but
these creatures are very skilful in brushing off their
tormentors by means of a branch held in their trunks. I
do not know what would become of me without these
good and docile animals, and I cannot tell which to
admire most, their patience or intelligence.</p>

<p>From Kone-Sane to Vien-Tiane is eight good days’
journey in a north-easterly direction.</p>

<p>To M’Lôm, four days W.N.W.</p>

<p>To Petchaboune, four days W.S.W.</p>

<p>To Kôrat, four days E.S.E.</p>

<p>To Chaiapume, four days E.S.E.</p>

<p>To Poukiéau, four days E.S.E.</p>

<p>To Leuye, three days’ rapid travelling N.N.E. over
mountains.</p>

<p>From Kone-Sane to Koukhène, two days’ rapid journey
E.S.E.</p>

<p>From Koukhène to Chenobote, one day’s journey S.E.</p>

<p>On the road from Kone-Sane to Leuye, near the former
place, is a stream called Oué-Mouan, and a torrent, Oué-Kha.</p>

<p>Bane-Nayaan, a village, five geographical leagues off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
two days’ journey, with high mountains to cross, difficult
of ascent for the elephants. On the first day your course
is over peaked mountains, volcanic, and like those of the
Khao Khoc. The next day you meet with calcareous and
volcanic hills; in the valleys sandstone, jungle, and fertile
ground.</p>

<p>Mgi-Lôm, four days’ journey west of Bane-Nayaan.
From this last place to Bane-Napitone runs the stream
Oué-Yan.</p>

<p>Menam-Fon-Khau, passed over twice, a geographical
league.</p>

<p>In the provinces of Kone-Sane and of Leuye a great
number of the inhabitants are affected with goître. Is
this caused by the water from the mountains and the
mineral substances with which it is impregnated? I
suppose so.</p>

<p>From Bane-Napitone to B. Proune you have to cross
high mountains. Half way up one of these is a fine view
extending over a wooded plain to the north-west in the
direction of Nong Khaï, and bounded at a distance of
twenty-five or thirty miles by a chain of mountains; whilst
in every other direction you are surrounded by hills varying
in height from 300 to 900 feet. The sandstone and
chalky rocks of these heights have taken most picturesque
forms.</p>

<p>From B. Proune to B. Thiassène runs a stream five
leagues long, in a north-westerly direction, and which is
navigable for boats. It flows on towards Leuye, and
empties itself in the Mekon at M. Sione-Kane, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
ten degrees N.N.E. of N. Thiassène. From B. Thienne to
Leuye are hills easy to climb, with vegetation similar to
those of Chantaboune and Brelum, forests of bamboo: the
rocks are calcareous, with a small mixture of sandstone.</p>

<p>The Menam-Rope and Menam-Ouaie are two large
rivers, deep in the rainy season, which empty themselves
into the Menam-Leuye: also several torrents. Villages:
Bane-Kataname, Bane-Poune, Bane-Nahane, Bane-Pathiou.</p>

<p>From Bane-Thienne to Nong Khane you go in an easterly
direction. Bane-Poua is the first village in a four
days’ journey: here are forests, jungles, and a small hill.
The plain is barren and desolate in appearance.</p>

<p>Towns and provinces of Louang Prabang in coming
down: Thienne-Khane, Nong-Kaïe, Saïabouri, Outène,
Lakhone-Penome, Mouke-Dahane, Emarate, and Bassac.</p>

<p>I am literally pillaged by these petty mandarins and
chiefs of villages, and have to give away guns, sabres,
lead, powder, colours, pencils, and even my paper; and
then, after having received their presents, they will not
put themselves out of their way to do me the smallest service.
I would not wish my most deadly foe, if I had
one, to undergo all the trouble and persecution of this
kind which I have encountered.</p>

<p>The Laotian priests are continually praying in their
pagodas; they make a frightful noise, chanting from
morning to night. Assuredly they ought to go direct to
Paradise.</p>

<p>Between Oué-Saïe and Thienne-Khane the villages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
are: Bane-Tate, B. Oué-Sake, B. Na-Saor, B. Poun, B.
Na-Poué, Nam-Khane, near B. Nmïen; near Kenne
Thao, between Bane Nam-Khane and Bane-Noke, is a
torrent called Nam-Kheme.</p>

<p>Observations taken at Kéte-Tao: Vienne-Thiane, eastward;
Mg. Nane, N.N.W.; Tchieng-Maïe, N.W.; Louang
Prabang, N. of Kenne Thao.</p>

<p>Mg. Dane-Saie, four days’ journey W.S.W. of Bane-Mien;
Lôme, four days’ journey W.S.W. of Bane-Mien.</p>

<p>Villages: Bane Thène, Nha-Khâ&mdash;two roads; Nâ-Thon&mdash;two
roads; Nâ-Di, Nâ-Moumone, Nâ-Ho, Bane Maïe,
B. Khok.</p>

<p>The river Menam-Ouan runs in a north-westerly direction
to within a day’s journey of the Menam-Sake. A
high mountain lies between them.</p>

<p>In Lôme the villages are: Bane Tali, B. Yao, B.
Khame, B. Pouksiéau, B. Name-Bongdiéau, B. Nong-Boa,
B. Na-Sane-Jenne, B. Nam-Soke, B. Ine-Uun, Dong-Saïe,
Bane Vang-Bane, B. Nang-Krang, Mg. Lôme-Kao, Bane
Koué-Nioune. Between M. Lôme-Maïe and Thiene-Khame
are Bane Oué-Saïe, B. Rate, B. Na-Shî, B. Oué-Pote,
B. Na-Sao, B. Loke, B. Na-Niaô, Thiene-Khame.</p>

<p>Between Kenne Thao and Bane Mien are B. Kone
Khêne, B. Pake-Oué, B. Khène-Toune.</p>

<p>The Mekon is ten leagues east of Kenne Thao.</p>

<p>M. Phitchaïe eight days’ journey west from Bane-Nmien.</p>

<p>At Bane-Nmien I found the Laotians even more ungrateful
and egotistical than elsewhere; they not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
will give you nothing&mdash;one has no right to expect it&mdash;but
after taking presents from you, they will make you
no return whatever.</p>

<p>The Menam-Ouan rises at Dane-Saïe, S.S.W. from
Kenne Thao, and joins the Mekon E.N.E. from that town.</p>

<p>From Kenne Thao to Louang Prabang is a distance of
seven geographical or ten ordinary leagues, and a journey
of ten or eleven days, quick travelling.</p>

<p>Mg. Pakhaie is north of Kenne Thao. From this place
to Bane-Na-Ine is one day’s journey; to Bane-Moun-Tioum
two days.</p>

<p>Near this latter place, where I have found a greater
number of insects than anywhere else in my travels here,
is the river Nam-Shan. It is a continual ascent to this
part.</p>

<p>Near Bane-Na-Ine auriferous quartz occurs. The jungle
here is thick.</p>

<p>Villages in the neighbourhood of Moun-Tioume, consisting
of from fifteen to thirty huts: Bane-Hape, a league
to the north; Rape-Jâ, the same distance southwards;
Tate-Dine, one league to the north-east; Nam-Poune, half
a league south-east.</p>

<p>In Bane Moun-Tioume are twenty-six houses.</p>

<p>Route from B. Moun-Tioume to B. Kouke-Niéou:&mdash;This
last village is composed of eighty houses. There is
in it an abandoned pagoda, and it is environed by woods
and hills. A stream, called the Nam-Peniou, flows past it
and joins the Nam-Shan. There is plenty of rice on the
hills, but not in the plains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>From Bane-Kouke-Niéou<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> there are continual hills.
We are tormented by immense numbers of leeches and
ox-flies. The jungle is as thick as in Dong Phya Phai.
We passed the night on the banks of a stream, the Nam-Koïe,
which we had several times crossed, but could get
no sleep on account of the leeches; and the following
night, by the same river, we were equally pestered.</p>

<p>Bane-Oué-Eu is a small hamlet in the immediate
vicinity of Kouke-Niéou-Paklaïe, a very pleasant town,
apparently prosperous. The houses are clean and elegant.</p>

<p>Paklaïe is two geographical leagues distant from Muang-Moune-Wâ.
The district is very mountainous, with rice-grounds
on some of the slopes. We several times had to
cross the Laïe, which is 35 metres wide, and rushes along
like a torrent, with a great noise. There are, about here,
many precipices. It was wonderful to see the elephants
climb, descend, and hang on by their trunks to the rocks
without ever making a false step.</p>

<p>I have quite an admiration and regard for these noble
animals. How remarkable are their strength and intelligence!
What should we have done without them amidst
these vast forests and rugged mountains?</p>

<p>Mgi-Roun, district of M. Louang, a day’s journey
W.N.W. of Mgi-Moune-Wâ; there are seventy houses
in it.</p>

<p>The villages near to Moune-Wâ are Bane-Bia, 2 miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
westward; Bane-Name-Pi, two days’ journey; Thiême-Khâne,
one day; B. Nam-Kang, one day. These villages
are all on the road from Mgi-Moune-Wâ to Phixaïe.
This place lies W.S.W. from Muang-Moune-Wâ, and five
days’ journey off, and three days’ journey from Nam-Pate.
The country between Mgi-Moune-Wâ and Nam-Pate
is mountainous; from the latter place to Phixaïe is
also hilly ground, and is part of the direct line from
Bangkok to Mgi-Louang.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>From Mgi-Moune-Wâ to Bane-Nakhau is a good day’s
journey over a mountain country, through woods of resinous
trees and high grass; but the jungle predominates.
Auriferous sand occurs in the Nam-Poune; also, though
less rich, in the Nam-Ouhan and other streams.</p>

<p>Bane-Phêke and B. Nalane lie between B. Nakhan and
Mgi-Nam-Poune.</p>

<p>Mgi-Nane is six days’ journey W.N.W. of Moune-Wâ.
The first day, to Mgi-Roun; second day, through woods
and crossing streams, to Nan-Pi (here are black-bellied
Laotians); third day, Bane-Khune; fourth day, Bane-Dhare;
fifth day, B. Done; sixth day, Tuke.</p>

<p>3rd September.&mdash;We left Bane-Nakhau, and arrived
about midday at a rice-field, where we passed the night.
All the women here have goîtres, often enormous and
most repulsive. Even young girls of nine or ten are to be
seen with them, but rarely the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>About Tourair there are woods and thick jungles, and
the river Nam-Poune, 60 metres broad, runs near. The
hills here are of moderate height. I saw some pretty
young girls with intelligent faces; but before the females
attain the age of eighteen or twenty their features become
coarse, and they grow fat. At five-and-thirty they look
like old witches.</p>

<p>Two rivers unite here, the Nam-Poune from the west,
and the Nam-Jame from the north.</p>

<p>On my route from B. Nakhau to B. Na-Lê, I spent
the night of the 4th of September in a hut at B. Nakone.
On the 5th I reached B. Na-Lê, passing through several
hamlets, Na-Moune, Na-Koua, and Na-Dua. Bane-Na-Lê
contains only seven houses.</p>

<p>The streams are, first, the Nam-Jame, crossed and recrossed
several times; the Nam-Quême, Nam-Itou, Nam-Pâne;
the Nam-Khou, near Bane-Nakone.</p>

<p>The road lies across high mountains, with jungles full
of monkeys uttering their plaintive cries. I was told of a
royal tiger at Na-Lê, which, in the space of four months,
had killed two men and ten buffaloes. I had the satisfaction
of killing the tigress.</p>

<p>5th September, 1861.&mdash;From this date M. Mouhot’s
observations cease; but until the 25th of October he
continued to keep his meteorological register.</p>

<p>The last dates inscribed in his journal are the <span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>20th September.&mdash;Left B......p.</p>

<p>28th.&mdash;An order was sent to B...., from the council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of Louang Prabang, commanding the authorities to prevent
my proceeding farther.</p>

<p>15th October. 58 degrees Fahr.&mdash;Set off for Louang
Prabang.</p>

<p>16th.&mdash;....</p>

<p>29th.&mdash;Have pity on me, oh my God....!</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF THE AUTHOR.</div>

<p>These words, written with a trembling and uncertain
hand, were the last found in M. Mouhot’s journal. His
faithful Phrai asked him several times if he did not wish
to write anything to his family, but his invariable answer
was, “Wait, wait; are you afraid?” The intrepid traveller
never for one moment thought that death was near;
he had been spared so far, and he doubtless thought he
should recover, or he might have made an effort to write
again. He died November 10th, 1861, at 7 o’clock in the
evening, having been previously insensible for three days,
before which time, however, he had complained of great
pains in his head. All the words which he uttered during
the delirium of the last three days were in English, and
were incomprehensible to his servants.</p>

<p>He was buried in the European fashion, in the presence
of his two servants, who never left him. It is the custom
of the country to hang up the dead bodies to the trees,
and there leave them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>This account of the last illness of my dear brother I
received from his friends at Bangkok, particularly Dr.
Campbell, to whom his two faithful servants hastened at
once to give all details. His collections and other property
they took to M. d’Istria, the French consul. Dr.
Campbell kindly took charge of the manuscripts, and
transmitted them to his widow in London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONCLUSION.</div>

<p>The family of M. Mouhot have already expressed their
gratitude to those who were useful and kind to the traveller.
The two good servants who remained with him
to the last also merit their thanks; and, if these lines
should fall into the hands of Phrai, I wish him to know
how much gratitude and esteem we feel for him, and for
his companion Deng. We wish them every happiness in
return for their devotion to my dear brother.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<h3>LIST OF THE NEW SPECIES OF MAMMALS DISCOVERED
BY THE LATE M. MOUHOT IN CAMBODIA AND SIAM.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Dr. Albert Günther.</span></p>


<h4><i>a.</i> <span class="smcap">Monkeys.</span></h4>


<h5>1. <i>Hylobates pileatus.</i></h5>

<div class="sidenote">MAMMALS.</div>

<p><i>Male.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Black</span>: back of the head, back of the body, and front
hind legs greyish; forehead and circumference of the black
spot on the crown paler grey: hands and tuft of long hair round
the organ of generation white.</p>

<p>The three specimens in this state are all nearly of the same
size, and appear to be adult. They only vary slightly in the
size of the coronal spot, and in the extent of the white colour on
the hands.</p>

of the sides with a longitudinal black streak, edged above and
below with a narrow white line: tail blackish, whitish washed,
hairs elongate, brown, with two broad black rings and a white

<h5>5. <i>Sciurus siamensis.</i></h5>

<p>Bright red-brown, grizzled, with elongate black tips to the
longer hairs, each of which is marked with a broad subterminal
yellow band. These black hairs are more abundant and have
broad pale rings on the rump, outside of the thighs, and especially
on the lower part of the tail, where they nearly hide the
general red colour. The terminal half of the tail bright chestnut-brown,
without any black hairs or pale rings. The throat,
breast, belly, lower part of sides, inner side and edge of the legs,
uniform bright red-brown: ears rounded: whiskers black: feet

<h5>6. <i>Tragulus affinis.</i></h5>

<p>Similar to T. javanicus in colour, but rather smaller and
much paler, and the side of the neck similar in colour to the
side of the body: the belly is white, with a brown streak on
each side of the central line: the head is smaller. It is larger
than <i>T. kanchil</i>; very much paler; and the neck is not blacker
and grizzled. A specimen of the species has been in the British
Museum, as above named, for many years: it is said to have
come from Singapore; but that probably was only the port of
transit. It may be only a small pale local variety of <i>T.
kanchil</i>.</p>

<p>Six specimens, adult, all exactly similar, and one young, have
been collected by M. Mouhot. (Gray, Proc. Zool. Soc., 1861,
p. 138.)</p>


<h5>7. <i>Cervulus cambojensis.</i></h5>

<p>There are the forehead covered with hair and the horns of
a Muntjack in the collection sent by M. Mouhot from Cambodia:
it is very much larger than any specimen of that genus
in the British Museum collection, and is probably a distinct
species.</p>

<p>The horns are thick, nearly straight, with a short, thick
recurved branch on the outer part of the front side, near the
base, and one of them has a somewhat similar callosity on the
hinder side on the same level. Hair of forehead very rigid,
close pressed, dark brown, with narrow yellow rings. (Gray,

<p>In the general habit and in all the generic characters the present
species completely agrees with <i>T. jaculator</i>; the snout,
however, is much shorter, its length being scarcely more than
the diameter of the eye, and considerably less than the width
between the orbits. The diameter of the eye is one-fourth of
the length of the head. The length of the base of the anal
equals exactly that of the dorsal. One of the largest scales
covers two-thirds of the eye.</p>

<p>The colour may prove to be subject to as much variation as
in the other species. The specimens described are yellowish,
with greenish back and yellowish caudal. There is a series of
four black blotches on each side: the anterior is the smallest,
and situated on the upper extremity of the præoperculum; the
third is the largest, and placed opposite the dorsal spines; a
narrow blackish band round the base of the caudal; a round
black spot on the posterior angle of the dorsal; the anal and the
ventrals are black.</p>

barbel on each side of the upper jaw; the head is covered with
small scales; there are about ten between the posterior angle of
the orbits; the snout is naked. Dorsal and anal fins much lower
than the body: one-half of the caudal is covered with thin
scales; its length is contained five times and a half in the
total. Brown: the lower parts whitish, minutely punctulated

<p>When we take the origin of the dorsal fin as the highest point
of the upper profile, and the base of the last anal spine as the
lowest of the abdomen, the depth between these two points is
one-half of the total length (the caudal not included). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
length of the head is three times and two-thirds in the same
length. The snout is broader than long, equal to the diameter
of the eye, which is one-fourth of the length of the head. The
interorbital space is convex, wider than the orbit. Mouth very
small, rather protractile; præorbital, with its extremity truncated
and serrated: angle of the præoperculum serrated; there
are two or three series of scales between the eye and the angle
of the præoperculum. The dorsal fin commences nearer to the
root of the caudal than to the end of the snout; it has six
strong spines, which increase in length posteriorly, the last
being longer than one-half the length of the head. Caudal
emarginate; the anal is nearly entirely scaly, and terminates
immediately before the caudal. The longest ventral ray extends
beyond the extremity of the caudal, and has three or
four rudimentary rays in its axil.</p>

<p>The colour is greenish on the back, silvery on the sides and
on the belly. A black spot on the middle of the body in the
vertical from the origin of the dorsal, below the lateral line; a
second on the middle of the root of the caudal. The soft dorsal

<p>The height of the body is one-half of the total length (without
caudal), the length of the head two-sevenths; the profile
of the nape is convex, that of the head rather concave. The
snout is somewhat depressed, broader than long, with the lower
jaw prominent; the interorbital space is convex, nearly twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
as wide as the orbit, the diameter of which is one-fifth of the
length of the head, and less than that of the snout. Præorbital
triangular, with the lower margin serrated; there are five
series of scales between the orbit and the angle of the præoperculum.
The entire lower margin of the præoperculum and a
part of the sub- and inter-operculum are serrated. The dorsal
fin commences on the middle of the distance between the snout
and the root of the caudal; its spines are moderately strong,
the length of the third being more than one-half of that of the
head. Caudal emarginate; more than one-half of the anal fin
is scaly; it terminates immediately before the caudal. The
longest ventral ray extends beyond the extremity of the caudal,

<p>The height of the body is contained twice and a third in the
total length, the length of the head thrice and a third; head as
high as long. Snout rather shorter than the eye, the diameter
of which is one-fourth of the length of the head, and equal to
the width of the interorbital space. The lower jaw is scarcely
longer than the upper, and the maxillary extends slightly beyond
the anterior margin of the orbit. Two nostrils remote
from each other, both very small. Præorbital and angle of the
præoperculum slightly serrated; opercles, throat, and isthmus,
entirely scaly. The dorsal fin commences above the end of the
operculum, and terminates close by the caudal; its spines are
very strong, and can be received in a groove; the fifth, sixth,
and seventh are the longest, not quite half as long as the head;
the last spine is shorter than the penultimate; the soft dorsal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
is elevated and scaly at the base. The second anal spine is
exceedingly strong, rather stronger and longer than the third,
and not quite half as long as the head; the soft anal is similar
to the soft dorsal. Caudal fin rounded, slightly produced, one-fourth
of the total length; its basal half is scaly. Pectoral
rather narrow, as long as the head without snout. The ventral
is inserted immediately behind the base of the pectoral; it has
a strong spine, and extends to the vent.</p>

<p>Scales minutely ciliated: the upper part of the lateral line
terminates below the last dorsal rays, the lower commences
above the third anal spine.</p>

<p>Gill-membranes united below the throat, not attached to the
isthmus, scaly. Four gills, a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiæ
none.</p>

<p>The jaws, vomer, palatines, and upper and lower pharyngeals
are armed with bands of small villiform teeth. Very remarkable
are two large, ovate, dentigerous plates, one at the roof, the
other at the bottom of the mouth, in front of the pharyngeals;
these plates are slightly concave in the middle, pavimentated
with molar-like teeth, and have evidently the same function
as the pharyngeal dentigerous plates of the true Pharyngognathi.</p>

eye and the angle of the præoperculum; scales on the upper
surface of the head of moderate size. The pectoral extends to
the origin of the anal fin, and its length is less than one-half of
that of the head: the ventral is not much shorter than the
pectoral; greenish-olive, with darker streaks along the series of
scales; a light longitudinal band from the eye to the middle of
the caudal fin; two series of alternate darker blotches, one
above the light band, the other below; side of the head with

of which is more than that of the orbit; the upper eye considerably
in advance of the lower: lips not fringed. The length
of the snout is contained twice and a third in that of the head,
the angle of the mouth being behind the vertical from the posterior
margin of the eye, and nearer to the gill-opening than to
the end of the snout. The rostral hook terminates below the
front margin of the eye. The height of the body is contained
four times and two-thirds in the total length, the length of the

<h3 class="break">DESCRIPTION BY M. LE COMTE DE CASTELNAU OF A
NEW AND GIGANTIC CARABIDEOUS INSECT DISCOVERED
BY M. MOUHOT IN LAOS.</h3>

<p class="center">(Communicated by the Count to the ‘Revue et Magasin de Zoologie.’
1862. No. 8. Paris.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIGANTIC CARABUS.</div>

<p>Among the magnificent insects that M. Mouhot collected
during the few months of his stay in Laos, the first place is
claimed by the beautiful Carabus which forms the subject of
this paper, and which I have named <i>Mouhotia gloriosa</i> after my
unfortunate countryman.</p>

<p>This splendid insect is black, with a large border of flame-colour
at the sides of the thorax and of the elytra; this is
covered with longitudinal striæ, formed by a double row of
punctures. The thorax is hollowed behind, smooth on the top,
with the lateral border a brilliant coppery-red; it presents a
small longitudinal stria in the middle of its disk, and the anterior
angles are very prominent.</p>

<p>It much resembles Pasimachus and Emydopterus, but is distinguished
from them; firstly, by the maxillary palpi, of which
the last joint is broad, flat, angular on the inner side, and
rounded at the end, this joint being a little longer than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
one before it; secondly, by the labrum, which is wide, short,
and indented on the exterior side; and thirdly, by the labial
palpi, which have their last joint in the same form as the
maxillary, but longer and hatchet-shaped. The mandibles are
very strong, moderately arched, striated transversely, and with
a strong tooth on the inner side; the jaws are also striated and
obtuse at the ends. The head is similar to that of Pasimachus,
the thorax is heart-shaped, the elytra oval, with angles towards
the joints not strongly marked, convex, and a little serrated
behind; the claws are powerful, with a strong tooth on the outer
side of the middle of the tibiæ of the centre pair.</p>

DISCOVERED BY M. MOUHOT IN THE INTERIOR OF
CAMBODIA.</h3>


<h4><i>Helix cambojiensis.</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">LAND-SHELLS.</div>

<p>Shell sinistral, deeply umbilicated, conoidly globose, rather
inflated; upper portion of the whorls of a rich-toned transparent
chestnut colour, edged at the satural margin with purple
black; lower portion of the whorls white, turning to a delicate
straw-colour by the overlying of a shining, transparent, horny
epidermis, encircled below the periphery and around the umbilicus
with two very decided, broad, rich purple black bands;
whorls six, corrugately puckered throughout at the satural margin,
the first four whorls very densely granosely wrinkle-striated
in the direction of the lines of growth, the striæ gradually disappearing
on the fifth whorl; aperture lunar-orbicular; lips
simple, reflected partly round the umbilicus.</p>

</a>
</div>

<p>Out of two thousand species of <i>Helix</i> at present known, the
only one of the same type as <i>H. Mouhoti</i> is the large <i>H. Brookei</i>,
collected by Mr. Arthur Adams, in company with Sir Edward
Belcher, on the mountains of Borneo, during the voyage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
‘Samarang,’ and described by Mr. Arthur Adams in the ‘Zoology’
of that expedition. <i>H. Mouhoti</i>, of which Mr. Stevens has received
a few specimens in various stages of growth, is even
larger and more inflated than <i>H. Brookei</i>. In adult specimens
the last whorl measures 6&frac12; inches in circumference, 3 inches in
diameter, and the shell is about 2 inches high. It differs from
<i>H. Brookei</i> in being conspicuously, but not broadly, umbilicated,
and in the mature lip not being in the least degree reflected at
the margin. The lip itself (not the margin) is reflected at its
junction with the body-whorl, partly round the umbilicus, as in
the <i>Nanina</i> form of the genus. But the most striking feature
of the species is the colouring. In <i>H. Brookei</i> the lower half
of the whorls is of a uniform dark chestnut-colour; in <i>H.
Mouhoti</i> it is pure white, turned to a bright straw colour by the
overlying of a shining horny epidermis, encircled immediately
below the periphery by a broad, rich, purple-black band, somewhat
like the bands of the large Philippine <i>Bulimus Reevei</i>,
but even broader and more defined on the white ground. The
region of the umbilicus is also deeply and as definitely stained
with the same purple-black colour. As in <i>H. Brookei</i>, all the
specimens of <i>H. Mouhoti</i> are sinistral, or what is more commonly
called reversed.</p>


<h4><i>Bulimus cambojiensis.</i></h4>

<p>This shell is either sinistral or dextral, cylindrically ovate,
thick, stout and pupoid in the spire, bluish-white, tinged with a
watery fawn-colour, and clouded throughout with oblique zigzag
flames of the same colour, darker, but very undefined and washy;
whorls seven, smooth, rather bulbous, faintly impressed concavely
below the suture; aperture ovate, of rather moderate
dimensions, overlaid in a very conspicuous manner across the
body-whorl, and over a very thickly reflected lip, with a callous,
opaque, milk-white deposit, which in the interior is stained with
a beautifully iridescent violet-rose. This fine species, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Mr. Stevens has received several specimens, measuring nearly 3
inches in length by 1&frac12; inch in width, is a most characteristic
example of a type of the Malayan province of the genus,
represented by the old <i>Bulimus citrinus</i> of Brugnière; and it
has been named after its well-authenticated place of habitation,
because the species is, in all probability, confined to that
locality. The islands adjacent to Cambodia have been pretty
well ransacked; and we have nothing like it in species either
from them or from the contiguous mainland of Siam on the
west, or Cochin China on the east. This particular type of the
genus appears, however, abundantly at the Moluccas, in <i>B. citrinus</i>;
and at Mindanao, the southernmost of the Philippine
Islands, in <i>B. maculiferus</i>. Like these two species, <i>B. cambojiensis</i>
occurs with the shell convoluted either to the right or to
the left. The shell is both larger and stouter than that of
<i>B. citrinus</i>, differently painted, and especially characterized by
its mouth of iridescent violet-rose, or what is now fashionably
termed “Solferino” colour.</p>

<h3 class="break">ATMOSPHERICAL OBSERVATIONS. </h3>


<div class="sidenote">ATMOSPHERICAL OBSERVATIONS.</div>

<p><i>January.</i>&mdash;The month of January at Bangkok is generally
the coolest in the whole year. The thermometer generally
ranges from 58° to 60° Fahr. in the morning. The wind is
sometimes N. or N.E., and at others S.S.W. or S. The rainy
season ends in the latter part of October; the water has fallen
in the rivers, which have not overflowed since the middle of
December; therefore at this time of the year one can walk along
the banks, which are pleasant. The paths are visible and in
a good state for travellers, and there is less danger, even in
the interior of the country, of being attacked by jungle fever.
There is often fog in the morning, but yet it is not unhealthy.
The weather has been fine all the month, excepting one or two
rainy days towards the middle.</p>

<p><i>February.</i>&mdash;During this month the wind frequently blows from
the N.E. or E., though sometimes from S.S.W. The weather
is fresh, agreeable, and healthy. It is the month which the
Buddhist pilgrims choose to visit Phrabat, where they imagine
they can trace the prints of Buddha’s feet. It is the best time
for crossing the jungles and the plains, for the banks are all
raised high above the water and the earth is perfectly dry. If
the wind blows from the S. for a few days, as it sometimes
does, the heat becomes overwhelming for the time. There are
also occasionally, as in January, two or three rainy days towards
the middle of the month.</p>

<p><i>March.</i>&mdash;This month is hotter and drier than the two preceding
ones; there is less freshness. The wind blows generally
from the E.N.E., S., or S.S.W., and often with great violence
during the day: the Siamese call it Som Won (wind of the
shuttlecock), of which game they are very fond, and one hears
everywhere their noise mingled with cries of admiration from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the people. Violent storms, accompanied by rain and thunder,
generally mark the equinox; after that the weather becomes
hot and dry. The thermometer sometimes rises as high as 93
in the middle of the day, but the nights are still pleasant.</p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;April is the hottest month of the year. The first
part is generally dry, with E. or S. winds, but changes about
the middle to N.E. and S.W. In the latter part of the
month the excessive heat is tempered by some refreshing rains.
Although the sun is very powerful during the day, the nights
at Bangkok are cool. This month is not so healthy for
Europeans as the three which precede it, and dysentery makes
great ravages.</p>

<p><i>May.</i>&mdash;This month is considered one of the most rainy of
the year, though sometimes July and September are more so.
The rain rarely lasts all day, and there are sometimes intervals
of two or three fine days. In this month the people prepare
their ground and sow their rice.</p>

<p><i>June.</i>&mdash;During the whole of this month the wind blows constantly
either from the S., W., or S.W. The jungles at this
season are fatal to travellers, especially to Europeans, who
would do wisely to avoid them and to pass this the rainy season
at Bangkok, which is one of the healthiest of the tropical
towns.</p>

<p><i>July.</i>&mdash;In July sweet and refreshing breezes blow from the
W. and S., but more rain falls than in June. There are
sometimes very hot days, when the thermometer rises very high,
but still in Siam this month is considered tolerably healthy.</p>

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;The same as July.</p>

<p><i>September.</i>&mdash;This is a month of almost incessant rain, and it
is very rare to have two or three consecutive fine days.</p>

<p><i>October.</i>&mdash;Everything is inundated, some of the streets of
Bangkok are transformed into canals, and the rivers everywhere
overflow their banks. The first part of this month is
as rainy as the preceding one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p><i>November.</i>&mdash;The Siamese now complain of the cold, but the
Europeans rejoice in it, for the N.E. wind begins to blow.
There are still some rainy days at the beginning of the month,
and some hot ones. These transitions of temperature give rise
to colds and catarrhs. At the end of the month the wind
changes to the S.W.</p>

<p><i>December.</i>&mdash;This is the best month to commence travelling
on the rivers. Occasionally there is thunder and rain, but
altogether it is considered a healthy month.</p>

<h3 class="break">TALE. </h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Translated from the Chinese by M. Henri Mouhot.</span></p>


<div class="sidenote">CHINESE TALES.</div>

<p>In a Chinese village lived two cousins, both orphans: the eldest,
who was called Moû, was cunning and egotistical; the other, on
the contrary, was goodness and simplicity itself; he was called
A-lo-Sine. The time for ploughing the fields arrived: A-lo-Sine
possessed a buffalo, while Moû had only a dog. An idea
struck him, and he went to his cousin and said, “I bring you
my dog; give me your buffalo: my dog will plough your field,
which is not very large, and you will see that you will have very
fine rice.”</p>

<p>A-lo-Sine consented, and worked so well with the dog that
his rice was first-rate, while the field ploughed by the buffalo
produced hardly anything.</p>

<p>Moû, then, full of spite, went by night into his cousin’s field,
and set fire to it: A-lo-Sine saw the flames, and, unable
to repress his despair, uttered piercing cries, and rolled in the
field.</p>

<p>Some apes, who were marauding in a neighbouring field,
witnessed this spectacle, and said to each other, “That must be
a god, since the fire does not hurt him.” They accordingly
drew near him, took him by the feet and arms, and carried him
to the top of a mountain, where they laid him down, plunged in
a deep sleep. The monkeys then piled up rice and delicious
fruits, and bowls of gold and silver of extraordinary beauty and
value, and then left him to return to the fields.</p>

<p>At last he awoke, and thought no more of his misfortune,
seeing around him so many treasures: he gathered them all up,
and returned to his hut, full of joy.</p>

<p>Moû, seeing him so happy, followed him, and, at the sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the gold, “Heavens!” cried he; “my cousin as rich as a prince:
give me something.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied A-lo-Sine, “I will not; for you are wicked,
and you set fire to my field.”</p>

<p>Moû then went to his own field, and set fire to that also,
and imitated all that his cousin had done: he wept, cried, and,
like him, threw himself into the flames. Five monkeys, one of
them a young one, who were feasting close by, drew near him,
curious to see what he was about. “He is a god,” said they,
also; “the flames have spared him. Let us carry him away.”
No sooner said than done. Each monkey seized one an arm,
the other a leg, and they set off.</p>

<p>They reached a neighbouring wood; but there the little
monkey began to cry out, “I want to help to carry him also.”
“But there is nothing of him to hold by,” said the mother. The
little monkey, however, continued to cry, and at last seized
Moû’s long tress of hair, and put himself at the head of the
procession.</p>

<p>But this hurt Moû, and he tried to disengage his hair.
The young monkey began to cry again. “Ah, you are angry;
stay there, then,” said all the others, and they threw him into a
prickly bush.</p>

<p>Moû had great trouble in extricating himself from his disagreeable
position; and it was nearly evening when he reached
home, all covered with blood.</p>

<p>“Well, cousin, have you also some gold and silver?” said
A-lo-Sine, on seeing him. “Ah! I am thoroughly punished for
the harm I did you,” replied Moû. “I bring back nothing but
needles: call the women to take them out of me.”</p>

<h3 class="break">TALE.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Translated from the Chinese by M. Henri Mouhot.</span></p>

<p>There lived formerly in a Chinese village an old couple who
had no children; and one day the husband put himself in a
violent passion with his wife for never having had any, and even
beat her. The poor old woman rushed out of the house, crying,
and ran a long way. A priest of Buddha met her accidentally,
and asked her what had happened to her. “My husband was
angry to-day, and beat me, because we had no children,” replied
she. “Listen,” said the priest; “I will make you happy! Dig
in this earth and knead it” (it was clay). The woman obeyed,
and the priest then sat down, and with his fingers moulded nine
little figures. “The first,” said he, “will have long ears and
very quick hearing; the second, a piercing sight; the third,
a skin so hard that he will not feel any blow; the fourth will
stand fire without hurt; the fifth will have an enormous head, as
hard as iron; the sixth, legs long enough to cross the deepest
stream; the seventh, feet as large as those of an elephant, for
walking in mire; the eighth, an immense stomach; and the
ninth, a nose as long as a pipe, from which jets of water
will issue at command. Now,” continued the priest, “go home,
and every year eat one of these children.” The old woman
bowed several times, professing her gratitude and happiness;
then she returned home; but in her joy, instead of contenting
herself with one child, she eat up all nine at once. Her stomach,
which had begun to swell at once, grew every month bigger
and bigger, and became frightful. The husband was beside
himself with joy, and was very kind to his wife.</p>

<p>At last the day of delivery arrived: the father received the
first child, and ran to wash him in the stream; but there came a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
second. “Another!” cried the father, and ran again to the
river. Returning, he found a third, then a fourth. He opened
his eyes and cried, “Really this is quite enough: what can we
give them to eat?” But the whole nine made their appearance
on the same day.</p>

<p>All were prodigies: they grew rapidly; never cried; eat
enormously, and began to run about in two months. But the
old man did not know what to call them all; and one day he
complained to his wife that he could not distinguish them one
from another, got in another passion, and struck her again.
The old woman ran away, crying, again, and went to find the
priest who had helped her before. “Why do you cry now?”
said he. “My husband has so many children now that he
does not know what names to give them.” “You are very foolish,”
replied he, “not to be able to distinguish them by the gifts
they possess. Call one ‘Quick-ear,’ another ‘Hard-head,’ and
so on for the others.”</p>

<p>The old man had calmed down when his wife returned; but
debts accumulated as the children grew up. At last they became
strong and fearless.</p>

<p>One day a creditor came and asked for money. “I have
none,” replied the old man. He persisted in this reply, and at
last turned the creditor out of the house. A few days after, this
man collected several of his friends, and went again to the old
man, declaring he would seize one of the children, and whip
him. “Quick-ear” had heard all, and “Piercing-eye” had
mounted to the top of a tree and seen all that was going on.
They decided that “Hard-skin” would be the best to go, and
the creditor succeeded in binding him and taking him away.
But every cane broke on his back, without hurting him: at last
they took an immense cudgel, but this broke in the same way;
and seeing that it was lost time to beat him, they let him go
home.</p>

<p>But a few days after, the creditor came back, determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
kill one of the children with boiling water. “Quick-ear”
heard the project, and “Invulnerable” was left at home, and
consequently carried off. They threw him into a boiler full of
water; and in about an hour, when they opened it, the child
raised his head. “What, not yet dead!” cried the creditor, in
a fury, and he made up a larger fire, but “Invulnerable” was
still alive. They made it still hotter, but the next day their
wood was exhausted, and they let him go free, saying that
Buddha protected him. “This is very sad,” said the creditor;
“I cannot get my money; I cannot get my money: I will
write a letter to Heaven, to beg that fire may be sent down to
burn the house of my debtor.” He did so accordingly; but
“Quick-ear,” who heard the plot, warned “Fountain-nose,” who
thereupon took care to water the roof. The thunderbolt fell,
but glided from the roof to the ground. All the children
joined their strength, and lifted it, chained it up, and placed
it in the house.</p>

<p>“Is it possible,” cried the creditor, “that they are not all
dead? I must throw one of them into the sea.” This time it
was “Stilt-bird’s” turn. The boat in which they placed him
had not gone far from the shore when a storm arose and upset
it, and all the men were drowned, with the exception of “Stilt-bird,”
who escaped, thanks to his long legs. However, his
brothers feared for him, and sent “Big-head” to the shore,
where he found him fishing, and having already caught so many
fish that he did not know where to put them. Luckily “Big-head”
had his hat, which they filled, and returned home with
an immense load. “Large-feet” went to cut wood to fry it
with; but “Great-stomach” eat it all up before his brothers
had hardly had time to begin. “Weeping-eyes” began to cry,
and an inundation ensued, in which many of the neighbours
perished.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all the children were out searching for food, and
the mother was left at home alone. She, seeing the thunderbolt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
chained in a corner, unfastened it. Immediately it rose
in the air, then, falling again, struck the poor woman, and
killed her.</p>

<p>Firmness and presence of mind often make heroes of cowards,
and rescue them from great dangers, while rashness is generally
fatal.</p>

<p>In the midst of a thick and virgin forest, where everything
seemed to slumber, an elephant began to utter doleful howlings,
and a tiger replied by others still more dreadful, which froze all
the other animals with terror. Monkeys, stags, and all the
inhabitants of the neighbourhood, ran groaning to seek refuge at
the tops of the trees, or in the depth of the woods, or in their
dens. The elephant himself ran with all his speed, when on his
way he met a hare, who stopped him, and said, “Why do you
run thus, without aim and without reason?” “What! did you
not hear the frightful roaring of the tiger? Would you advise
me to stay here and be devoured?” “Stay here, and have no
fear; I will answer for it that no harm happens to you,” said
the hare; “only sit down, that I may jump on your back.”
The elephant goodnaturedly approached and extended his four
legs; then the hare jumped up, having first put into his mouth
a piece of betel.</p>

<p>“Now, get up again,” said he, “and you will see that all will
go well.” He then proceeded to give the elephant further counsel,
and afterwards let out along his back a long stream of
saliva, reddened by betel. Soon the tiger came up. “What
are you coming to seek here?” said the hare, as the tiger
stopped to look at them. “Do you not see that this elephant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
is not too much for me alone; and do you think I will share
with you?” The tiger drew aside, behind a tree, to watch
what passed. The hare then seized hold of the elephant’s ear,
made him roar, and seemed perfectly master of his prey, and
busy at his work. “Heavens! how strong he is!” said the
tiger; but still he drew near. “Wait a minute, and I will come
to you,” cried the hare, looking as though preparing to spring,
and the tiger, struck with terror, turned and ran away. A
chimpanzee, seeing him running away in such terror, burst
out laughing. “What! you laugh at my misfortune?” cried
the tiger. “I have just escaped from death, and you do not
pity me.” “How so? I should like to see the beast who frightened
you; take me to him.”</p>

<p>“What! to be devoured? no.”</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid; I will get on your back, and will not
leave you: we will fasten our tails together, if you like; and
thus united we shall run no risk!” The tiger was persuaded
by these words, and they both returned to the elephant. The
hare seemed still busy at his work: he had chewed a new
piece of betel, and had made another stream, red as blood, on
the elephant’s back. “You dare to come back!” cried he, in
an angry tone, to the tiger. “You knew I had only just enough
here for myself, and yet you want to carry away my prey from
me; you deserve to be punished.”</p>

<p>At these words the elephant uttered a piercing cry; the
hare made an enormous bound on his back; and the tiger,
struck with terror, rushed precipitately away at full speed,
saying to the chimpanzee, “Now, you see; you laughed at my
fears, and we both narrowly escaped death.” But the chimpanzee
did not hear; for in the tiger’s precipitate retreat he had
fallen off his back, struck himself against a bamboo, and died,
cursing his rashness with his last sigh.</p>

<h3 class="break">THE HARE AND THE SNAIL.<br />

FABLE.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Translated from the Chinese by M. Henri Mouhot.</span></p>

<p>Formerly, according to the Siamese, hares had thick ears; but
a certain day one of these animals, having more legs than
memory, met a snail dragging himself painfully along the
ground, and in a moment of pride sought to humiliate him.
“Why, little one, where are you going at this pace?” said he.
“To the beautiful rice-fields of the next village.” “But, my
poor fellow, you will be a long time reaching them. Why did
not Nature furnish you with legs like mine? Confess you envy
me. How long, now, do you think it would take me to get
there?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps longer than it would take me, though you pity me
so much,” replied the snail, coldly.</p>

<p>“You jest, do you not?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, will you bet about it?”</p>

<p>“Willingly.”</p>

<p>“What will you bet?”</p>

<p>“Whatever you like.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, if you win you shall nibble my ears; for you
cannot eat me; and if you lose I will eat you: will that suit
you?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“Then set off; for I will give you a start.”</p>

<p>While the hare began to browse the snail set off at his slow
pace, and went to his brother, who was a little way off, and to
him he communicated a pass-word, which he in turn told to
another, and so on along the whole line which the betters had to
travel, so that it quickly reached the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon the hare, having satisfied his hunger, and feeling strong,
set off, and flew over the ground, calling to the snail, whom he
believed to be close by. “Ohé!” answered he, from a long
way off. “Oh, he is already far on the way,” cried the hare, who
set off again like an arrow. In a few minutes he stopped and
called again: “Ohé,” answered a voice still farther on. “Really,
he goes very quickly,” thought the hare, and he set off again.
A quarter of an hour after, he stopped, quite out of breath.
“Now,” said he, “I may rest; I must be far in advance; but
I will call and see.” “Ohé! snail.” “Ohé!” replied a voice
a long way on. “Oh! I must be quick; I shall lose my bet,”
murmured the hare. He ran, and ran, and at last stopped,
quite exhausted, only a few yards from the fields. “Snail,”
cried he, faintly: “what! you are returning from the place?
Unfortunate that I am, I have lost my bet;” and he made vain
efforts to get up and escape, but, alas! his strength failed him,
and the snail pitilessly gnawed his ears.</p>

<p>Since that day the hare always avoids damp places, for fear
of meeting one of the creatures who punished him for his
pride.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE TALE.</div>

<p>There lived formerly in a small town in China a singular
couple, of a description still met with, for the Chinese progress
very slowly. The husband was noted for his folly, and the wife
for her cunning. “Always remember,” she used constantly to
say to her husband when he went out, “that all people with
long noses, in the form of an eagle’s beak, and bending downwards,
are good-for-nothings, beggars, cheats, and, worse still,
bad paymasters, coiners of false money, false-swearers, and will
go to hell; while people with small turned-up noses are good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and will go straight to heaven. Therefore, that you may not
lose, sell only to these last; for, I repeat to you, the others
are bad.”</p>

<p>Every day the husband went out, and passed from street to
street, examining the passers-by, but never addressing any but
those who had their heads raised to look at something, so that
he very seldom sold anything.</p>

<p>One day, when he was observing noses as usual, he saw a
man reading a placard which was placed very high. “That
man will go straight to heaven,” thought he; “his nose is so
much turned up. Will you buy some clothes, good man?”
said he. “Clothes! you see I have some.” “But you appear
to me the most honest man I ever saw” (“I never saw such a
nose,” he added to himself); “and I should like to sell you a
whole suit; my wife makes them herself.” “Well, what is the
price?” “Of my wife?” “No; of the clothes.” “Two
kóóu” (about ten francs). “But why do you come into this
retired place to sell your clothes, when there are so many
people elsewhere?” “Oh! I went to those places; but all
the people had long, bent, and eagle-shaped noses, you see! and
I only sell to snub-nosed people.” “I do not understand you;
why will you not sell to people with long noses?” “My wife,
who is a very clever woman, told me that all people with long,
eagle-shaped noses are knaves.” “Really, your wife is very
sharp, and I understand you now. Well, my friend, I will buy
your clothes; but as I have no money with me, I will pay you
to-morrow. You have only to come to my house; I live near
here. You will see a hurdle covered with eggs, a flag at the
end of a mast, and a little plantation of betel.” “Very well;
that will do.”</p>

<p>The merchant went home to his wife, and told her he had
sold to a man with a snub nose. “Where is the money?” said
she. “I have not got it yet, but I shall be sure to have it to-morrow.
I am to go where I see a hurdle covered with eggs, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
flag on a mast, and a little betel plantation.” The next day the
wife said, “Go for your money.” He went, but could not find
the house; and after long searching he came home again.
“Have you the money?” said the wife. “No, I could not find
the house.” “Well, I will go myself to look for it. If I am not
back in an hour, you will know that I am drowned.” After an
hour, as his wife did not return, the man took the sieve with
which he usually sifted his rice, and set off to the river, which
he began to try to empty with it. A passer-by asked him what
he was doing. “I am emptying the river,” replied he; “for my
wife is drowned, and she had on her best yellow bonnet.”
“Nonsense!” said the other; “I just met her walking with a
man who had a snub nose.”</p>




<h3 class="break">THE DAMIER, OR CAPE PIGEON. </h3>

<p class="center"><i>Procellaria Capensis.</i></p>


<div class="sidenote">THE CAPE PIGEON.</div>

<p>During a long voyage, when for months you have seen nothing
but water and sky, the smallest novelty which appears and promises
variety for the eye and the mind, though only for a few
minutes, is joyfully welcome. Sometimes it may be a stormy
petrel, flying like a swallow, skimming through the air in a
hundred different directions, and seeming to play in that element;
sometimes a ring-tail, which, with its piercing cry like
that of a hawk, appears a messenger from the sun to bid the
bold navigator welcome to the tropics, hovers for a few minutes
over the ship, and then flies off with a jerk and disappears.</p>

<p>Sometimes are to be seen numerous blowers, who pass and
repass the ship with bounds; or perhaps a whale, which almost
stupefies you with the noise he makes as he displaces the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
in rising to the surface to breathe: at another time it is some
hungry shark, who, following in the wake of the ship, lets himself
be caught by the bait thrown out to him, and which, when
hoisted with great difficulty on deck, lashes it with his tail and
looks formidable even after death; and this is a good take for
the sailors, who divide the spoil and feast on it.</p>

<p>But of all the creatures dear and familiar to sailors, none
rejoices him more than the faithful companion who, more than
3000 miles before he doubles the Cape of Good Hope or Cape
Horn, appears to his sight, swims in the water, grazes a thousand
times the hull or the rigging, pleases his eye by its parti-coloured
plumage, and announces to him calm and tempest.</p>

<p>This bird, called by the French “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Damier</i>,” by the English
the <i>Cape Pigeon</i>, and “<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Peintada</i>” by the Portuguese, is the Cape
Petrel, or <i>Procellaria capensis</i> of naturalists.</p>

<p>Gifted with great powers of flight, though less than other
petrels, from morn till night, and often even a part of the latter
when the moon is full, it is seen in the wake or alongside of
the ship, describing in its flight, in which scarcely any movement
is apparent, a thousand evolutions, sometimes touching
the great waves which seem ready to overwhelm it, the moment
after reappearing far above them, always wheeling about
and careless of the storm.</p>

<p>The sight of this flight and of all these evolutions is most
pleasing, and one involuntarily thinks of a graceful skater
flying over the ice at his utmost speed, and seeking to attract
admiration.</p>

<p>The whole life of this bird is perpetual movement, a constant
chase after a scarce and insignificant prey. Unlike the
swallow, who has his hours of pleasure and of amorous warbling,
and nights of sleep in his warm nest, the Cape pigeon, pressed
by hunger and by his ravenous appetite, only rests for a few
minutes at a time at rare intervals during the day, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
recruit his strength, and at night, rocked by the stormy wave,
must find but little sleep.</p>

<p>Neither does the Cape pigeon know the delight of a peaceful
retreat in a favourite spot sheltered by thick foliage or long
reeds; and while most birds confine themselves to a limited district,
where they are almost certain to be found at the same
season, and to which they invariably return at the disappearance
of the frosts which have chased them away for a time,
this one, a sailor by nature, has for its domain an immense
empire, namely the greatest part of the Atlantic, Pacific, and
Indian oceans, and has to brave night and day, at one time an
icy wind, and at another the rays of a burning sun.</p>

<p>But in a state of liberty nothing living is often unhappy, and
the foreseeing Providence, who knows how to satisfy the wants
of his creatures, also knows how to create joys for them, where
we see nothing but trouble and misery. In like manner the
industrious workman and the hardy traveller experience, perhaps,
of all men the most lively joys; to them repose would be
the greatest suffering.</p>

<p>Although inseparable companions of the sailor, it is not certainly
for the pleasure of his society, nor for that afforded by
the sight of the ship, that the petrels follow it, but for the
certainty of finding in the scraps thrown overboard, as well as
in the number of shells in the wake of the ship, food more
abundant than he would discover elsewhere in the water. Nothing
can equal their voracity but the quickness and vivacity
with which they catch sight of the smallest prey and seize it
even amidst a stormy sea. From a great distance, and long
before the albatross, and the other descriptions of petrels which
are often to be seen with the Cape pigeons, have remarked it,
they see and pounce on it, and have generally swallowed it
before the jealous rivals who follow them have been able to
overtake them. The sense of smell does not here come in aid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of that of sight, for they often pounce on a piece of wood or
something of that description which falls from a vessel, and
only abandon it when convinced by the touch that it is not fit
for food. Their greediness is such that they will often let
themselves be taken in dozens with hooks; no sooner are they
on deck than they disgorge a thick liquid the colour of linseed
oil.</p>

<p>When these birds rest on the sea and let themselves be tossed
about by the waves, their appearance, dimensions, form, and
colour of plumage strongly resemble our domestic pigeons, and
hence the English seamen, struck with the similarity, have
given them the name of Cape pigeons. Their size varies; the
largest measuring more than 18 inches English from the beak
to the tip of the tail, and rather more than a foot in circumference.</p>

<p>They are generally seen in great numbers only in stormy
weather and in rather high latitudes. In the winter season&mdash;that
is, during our June, July, and August&mdash;they follow
the ships constantly between 23° S. lat. and 31° and 103°
E. long.</p>

<p>Is it not a wonderful thing and worthy of admiration that
the instinct with which this bold little navigator is endowed
guides him safely through this vast space, where there is
nothing to serve him as a landmark, enables him to rejoin his
comrades if accidentally separated from them, and teaches him
every year when the warm season returns to recognise and find
the island or the solitary rock where he was born, and where
in his turn he will bring up his young ones; while man, with
his maps, his books, his nautical instruments, and in spite of all
his long experience, has such difficulty in finding his way across
the ocean? And yet we think that our intelligence raises us
above the animals. This is what confounds and overwhelms
the scholar when he seeks to fathom the great mysteries of
creation.</p>

<h3 class="break">THE ALBATROSS. </h3>


<div class="sidenote">THE ALBATROSS</div>

<p>A wise and bountiful Providence has taken care to people
the most distant and desert parts of the globe, whether covered
with eternal snow or impenetrable forests. In the waters of
the ocean are, as well as in our fields and woods, creatures
which rejoice the eyes of man and provide for his wants. Of all
these creatures none are more charming and pleasing than the
birds; endowed either with melodious voices or brilliant plumage,
or with some other charm or quality, such as vivacity,
quickness and grace of movement, and power of flight; all have
attractions for us; and even in our museums, in spite of their
faded plumage and often altered forms, they are still objects
of admiration, not only to the learned naturalist, but to men
who care little for other beautiful sights.</p>

<p>But if leaving the cabinet we visit Nature herself, penetrate
into the heart of the forests, climb the rocks, or visit the shores
and the ocean, then our admiration grows stronger and more
deep.</p>

<p>Of all birds there is none which exercises a greater influence
over the mind of man, or causes greater astonishment, than the
albatross, so celebrated by voyagers from the earliest times.
The albatross! The word recalls to the navigator a thousand
souvenirs; as the name of some bloody battle in which he has
taken part, or of some general who has led him to victory,
awakens those of the soldier. It recalls to the memory of the
sailor the principal incidents of an existence passed between
calm and tempest; he feels himself transported in thought to
the time when the first albatross was signalled, and passengers
and sailors turned their gaze eagerly towards the spot where,
like a proud man of war, cradled by the rolling waves, advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the powerful sailer against whom the storm rages in vain, and
who, far from avoiding, seems to court it.</p>

<p>To this first souvenir succeed many others; there is the
dead calm, which in the tropics has often detained his vessel
inactive for weeks, as though chained under the burning sky,
where the eye seeks in vain for a cloud, and the only sound
that meets the ear is the heavy flapping of the sails against the
masts as the ship rocks; a calm often more to be feared and
more dangerous than the most terrible tempest, for it renders
the crew inactive, impatient, and bad-tempered. But the first
sight of the albatross indicates a coming change and wind to
be expected. There is also the memory of painful and too
sudden transitions from equatorial heat to the cold of high latitudes;
that also of hours of dreadful anxiety when the storm
broke out in all its violence, of the contest between winds and
waves, and of the albatross hovering over the latter, as though
chosen an umpire between these two formidable antagonists.
The albatross inhabits the southern hemisphere of the Atlantic
Ocean from the 25° or 26° of latitude, also both Pacifics, but is
rarely seen farther north, and has never been known beyond the
tropics; it is in the seas which bathe the three southern capes
that they are seen in the greatest numbers.</p>

<p>It often happens, however, when the winter is mild and
the weather fine, that very few are seen until you reach the 40°.
They lay their eggs on some deserted southern shore; the
female lays only one, and feeds her little one for nine months
without leaving it, so much need has it of its mother’s help.</p>

<p>There is much difficulty in the classification of the palmipeds,
which exhibit a great number of varieties.</p>

<p>The beak of the albatross is long and very strong; the upper
jaw furrowed at the side and much curved; the lower one
sharp, smooth, and truncated at the end; the nostrils, formed by
two tubes opening outwards, are lateral and placed in a groove.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
The tarsi are short, but very thick, and ending in three front
toes much palmated; the wings are long and narrow.</p>

<p>There are probably four distinct species of albatrosses.</p>

<p>1st. The wandering albatross, <i>Diomedea exulans</i>, which
measures ten feet with the wings spread; it has a white head,
the wings and belly being spotted with white, grey, and chestnut
brown; the beak is the colour of horn. This species varies
much in size, and still more in colour and plumage, which is
more or less mixed with grey or brown, and sometimes even
entirely white; this depends doubtless on the season, the sex,
and the age.</p>

<p>2nd. The epauletted albatross, <i>Diomedea epomophera</i>, which
is smaller than the common albatross. His head, neck, body,
back, and rump are snowy white, while the feathers of his wings
are perfectly black, with the exception of a large white lozenge-shaped
spot on each; the beak is yellowish. Some naturalists
believe these to be only the young of the ordinary kind.</p>

<p>3rd. The yellow-beaked albatross, <i>Diomedea chlororhyncos</i>.
This species I have myself taken with a hook; his head, belly,
and neck are brilliantly white, his back and the plumage of the
wings a deep brown grey, the beak yellow, and the feet bluish
grey; the rump is white, and as well as the underpart of the tail
is bordered by a wide black line.</p>

<p>4th. The sooty albatross, <i>Diomedea spadicea</i> of Forster, which
is the size of the common albatross, and of a uniform deep
chestnut-colour.</p>

<h3 class="break">LETTERS FROM M. MOUHOT. </h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">To Samuel Stevens, Esq.</span></h4>

<p class="center">[To be communicated to the Royal Geographical Society.]</p>

<p class="dateline">
Brelum, among the Savage Stiêns, lat. N. 11° 46′ 30″,
long. W. 103° 3′, merid. of Paris, 15th October, 1859.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Stevens</span>,</p>

<p>I profit by a favourable opportunity which has just
presented itself to write you a few hasty lines to let you know
that I am alive. For the last two months I have been living
with the savage Stiêns amidst their immense forests, the latitude
being precisely as I have stated above, and here I have
passed the season most favourable for collecting insects and
land shells. In spite of the letter given to me by the King of
Cambodia, ordering all the chiefs of the Srok Khmer, or Cambodian
villages, to furnish me with the means of transport on
my journey, I experienced much difficulty, as frequently neither
buffaloes nor carts were to be found in the hamlets through
which I passed. My journey took me a month to accomplish,
which is about three times as long as it would have taken me
on foot.</p>

<p>On the 21st July, after having descended the great arm of
the Mekon from Pinhalú, a village about nine miles from the
capital, and in lat. 11° 46′ 30″ N. and long. 103° 3 W. merid.
of Paris, as far as Penom Peuh, a commercial town filled with
Chinese, and situated at the conflux of two streams, I ascended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the great Cambodian River, the water of which is still low, as
all through the country the rainy season is two months later
than usual. The Mekon is studded with islands, of which many
are eight or nine miles long and more than a mile broad;
such is the large and beautiful island of Ko-Sutin, where I
arrived after five days’ journey. I estimate the width of the river
to be about three miles. Pelicans are found on its waters, often
in flocks of more than fifty, and storks, sea swallows, and other
aquatic birds, abound in the shallow parts of the river. The
general aspect of this mighty river is, however, rather sombre
than gay, although doubtless there is something imposing in
the rapidity of its waters, which run like a torrent. Few boats
are to be seen on it, and its banks are almost barren (the forests
being more than a mile distant), and, being constantly undermined
by the water, fall down at the least shock, and this is generally
all that you can see or hear. The Menam is much more
gay and animated.</p>

<p>The rapids and cataracts commence about thirty or forty
leagues north of Ko-Sutin, on the confines of Laos, and it is
there necessary to leave the large boats and take to canoes,
which as well as the luggage are often obliged to be carried on
men’s backs.</p>

<p>The current of the Mekon is so strong that at certain times
of the year you can go little more than a league a day, and the
rowers often seek for fire in the evening at the very place
where they cooked their rice in the morning. I ascended it
in a small boat with three rowers, but at every bend of the river
we had the greatest trouble to make any progress, and were
frequently obliged to hold on by the rushes to prevent our
being carried away by the current. Eight days after leaving
Pinhalú I reached Pemptiélan, a large Cambodian village, where
I found it necessary to take to land travelling.</p>

<p>There still remained 150 miles to travel in carts, all in
an easterly direction. I was well received by the mandarin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
at the head of affairs in this part of the country, and was able
to set out again in two days.</p>

<p>The first day our conveyances upset, and I feared that we
should be unable to proceed; there were continually dreadful
bogs, quagmires, and marshes, in which the carts sank up to the
axletrees and the buffaloes to their bellies. Fortunately on the
following day the road improved, but for three weeks all that
was visible was a few scattered rice-fields round the villages, and
we had to make our way through a marshy plain, covered with
thick and dark woods, which reminded one of the enchanted
forest of Tasso, and it is easy to understand that the imagination
of a pagan race peoples these gloomy solitudes with evil
spirits. Twenty times in an hour the men who accompanied
us were obliged to raise the large branches and cut down the
trunks which obstructed our passage, and sometimes we had to
make a new path for ourselves.</p>

<p>The Cambodians were all much surprised at seeing us journeying
towards the Stiêns at the worst time of the year, for in
that country the rainy season had commenced, and even those
who live nearest dare not venture there; and had I not brought
with me from Siam my two young servants, I could not for
any money have found a single individual to accompany me.
Even they felt great repugnance to proceed&mdash;for in Siam, Cambodia
bears a terrible reputation for unhealthiness, and unhappily
both for them and for myself they were attacked with fever
in the forests, since which, instead of receiving any help from
them, I have had two patients to nurse.</p>

<p>Passing through a village peopled by a barbarous race of
Annamites, I ran great risk of being taken prisoner by them,
and being sent to finish my researches in a dungeon. Last year
the carriages belonging to a French missionary were completely
rifled, and the men sent with ropes round their necks to Cochin
China. I loaded all my guns, and gave one to each of my men:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
our firm appearance, no doubt, frightened them, for we were not
attacked.</p>

<p>In spite of the heat, the fatigue, and privations inseparable
from such a journey, I arrived among the Stiêns in perfectly
good health as far as I was concerned, and here I found a settlement
of Catholic missionaries from Cochin China. It would
have been impossible to go further, for I could neither find
means of transport nor provisions, for at this time of the year
the poor savages have consumed all their rice, and have nothing
to live upon but herbs, a little maize, and what they can catch
in the chase. I therefore accepted the hospitality offered to
me with much kindness by a good priest. In a few weeks the
rainy season will be over, the nights will become cold, and for
several months insects will be found, and after that will come
the turn of the birds, with which I shall exclusively occupy
myself.</p>

<p>My departure from here will depend upon circumstances;
perhaps I shall myself be the bearer of this letter to Pinhalú,
perhaps I may be detained here some months by the bad state of
the roads and the impossibility of procuring vehicles during the
rice-harvest.</p>

<p>If you ask who are this strange people, living retired on the
table-lands and mountains of Cambodia, which they appear never
to have quitted, and differing entirely in manners, language,
and features from the Annamites, Cambodians, and Laotians,
my answer is that I believe them to be the aborigines of the
country, and that they have been driven into these districts by
the repeated inroads of the Thibetians, from whom they evidently
descend, as is proved by the resemblance of features,
religion, and character.</p>

<p>The whole country from the eastern side of the mountains
of Cochin China as far as 103° long., and from 11° lat. to Laos,
is inhabited by savage tribes, all known under one name, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
signifies “inhabitants of the heights.” They have no attachment
to the soil, and frequently change their abode; most of the
villages are in a state of continual hostility with each other, but
they do not attack in troops, but seek to surprise each other,
and the prisoners are sold as slaves to the Laotians.</p>

<p>Their only weapon is the cross-bow, which they use with extraordinary
skill, but rarely at a distance of more than twenty
paces. Poisoned arrows are used only for hunting the larger
animals, such as elephants, rhinoceros, buffaloes, and wild oxen,
and with these the smallest scratch causes death, if the poison
is fresh: the strongest animal does not go more than fifty paces
before it falls; they then cut out the wounded part, half roast it
without skinning or cutting it up, after which they summon
the whole village by sound of trumpet to partake of it. The
most perfect equality and fraternity reign in these little communities,
and the Communists would here find their theories
reduced to practice and producing nothing but misery.</p>

<p>The strongest European would find it difficult to bend the
bow which the Stiên, weak and frail as he appears, bends without
effort, doubtless by long practice.</p>

<p>They are not unacquainted with agriculture, but grow rice
and plant gourds, melons, bananas, and other fruit-trees;
their rice-fields are kept with the greatest care, but nearly all
the hard work is done by the women. They seldom go out in
the rainy season on account of the leeches, which abound in the
woods to such a degree as to render them almost unapproachable;
they remain in their fields, where they construct small huts
of bamboo, but as soon as the harvest is over and the dry
season returns they are continually out fishing or hunting.
They never go out without their baskets on their backs, and
carrying their bows and a large knife-blade in a bamboo
handle. They forge nearly all their instruments from ore
which they procure from Annam and Cambodia. Although
they know how to make earthen vessels, they generally cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
their rice and herbs in bamboo. Their only clothing is a strip
of cloth passed between the thighs and rolled round the waist.
The women weave these scarfs, which are long and rather
pretty, and which when well made often sell for as much as an
ox. They are fond of ornaments, and always have their feet,
arms, and fingers covered with rings made of thick brass wire;
they wear necklaces of glass beads, and their ears are pierced
with an enormous hole, through which they hang the bone of
an animal, or a piece of ivory sometimes more than three inches
in circumference. They wear their hair long in the Annamite
fashion, and knot it up with a comb made of bamboo; some pass
through it a kind of arrow made of brass wire, and ornamented
by a pheasant’s crest.</p>

<p>Their features are handsome and sometimes regular, and
many wear thick mustachios and imperials.</p>

<p>Quite alone and independent amidst their forests, they
scarcely recognise any authority but that of the chief of the
village, whose dignity is generally hereditary. For the last year
or two the King of Cambodia has occasionally sent the mandarin
who lives nearest the Stiêns to their first villages, in
order to distribute marks of honour to their chiefs, hoping little
by little to subdue them, and to get from them slaves and ivory,
and already he receives a small tribute every year. His emissaries,
however, scarcely dare pass the limits of the kingdom,
so fearful are they of the arrows of the savages and of the
fevers which reign in their forests.</p>

<p>The Stiên is gentle and hospitable, and possesses neither
the stupid pride of the Cambodian, nor the refined cruelty and
corruption of the Annamite. He is the “good fellow” of the
forest, simple and even generous; his faults are those common
to all Asiatics, namely, cunning, an extraordinary power of
dissimulation, and idleness; his great passion is hunting, and
he leaves work to the women, but, unlike the Cambodians, robbery
is very rare among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>They believe in a supreme being, but only invoke the evil
spirit to induce him to leave them in peace. They bury the
dead near their dwellings. They do not believe in metempsychosis,
but think that animals have also souls which live after
their death, and continue to haunt the places they frequented in
their lives. Their superstitions are numerous; the cry of an owl,
or the sight of a crow, just as they are about to set off on a
journey, they consider a bad augury, which is sufficient to turn
them from their plans.</p>

<p>When any one is ill they say it is the demon tormenting
him, and keep up night and day a frightful uproar round him,
which only ceases when one of the bystanders falls as in a fit,
crying out, “He has passed into me, he is stifling me.”
They then question the new patient as to the remedies which
must be employed to cure the sick man, and as to what the
demon demands to abandon his prey. Sometimes it is an ox,
a pig, too often a human victim; in the latter case they
pitilessly seize on some poor slave, and immolate him without
remorse.</p>

<p>They imagine that all white people inhabit secluded corners
of the earth in the midst of the sea, and often ask if there
are any women in our country. When and how I can return
to Cambodia and Siam I am ignorant, and I dare not think of
the difficulty I shall experience among the rude and stupid
Cambodians in transporting my treasures. What heartbreaking
jolts my boxes of insects will receive! What palpitations I
shall feel each time some rough fellow takes them to place on
the oxen, elephants, or his own back! Poor soldiers of science!
these are our trophies, and in the eyes of some people find as
much merit as a piece of silk fastened to a pole; and what
pains, patience, and solicitude is necessary to procure them!
therefore I believe my anxiety as to my collections will be
understood by the lovers of nature.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I arrived last evening at Pinhalú, in perfect health, and
am now about to go northward to visit the famous ruins of
Ongcor and then return to Bangkok, so I have little time to give
you any details as to what I despatch from Komput and Singapore.
I am not quite satisfied; for birds are scarce here, and I
have but a small number; besides, my boxes as I feared have
been much knocked about; I sent them off to Komput on men’s
backs. On my return to Bangkok I will send you some good
maps of this almost unknown country.</p>

<p class="dateline">
Khao Samoune, Province of Pechaburi (Siam).
Lat. N. 13° 4′, long. 100°. 15th June, 1860.
</p>

<p>In my last letter, of March, 1859, I told you about two
active volcanoes that I discovered in the Gulf of Siam, one in
the little isle of Koman, lat. 12° 30′ 29″ N., and long. 101° 50′ 2″
W., mer. of Greenwich, and of the probable existence of others
whose workings were latent and slow. Since then I have travelled
through Cambodia, from north to south and from east
to west, gone up the Mekon as far as the frontier of Laos, visited
one of the savage tribes which live between these two countries
and Cochin China, then crossed the great lake Touli Sap, explored
the provinces of Ongcor and Battambong, which are full
of splendid ruins, one of which in particular, the temple of
Ongcor, is almost perfect, and, perhaps, unequalled in the world.
I then passed from the Mekon to the Menam, and returned to
Bangkok.</p>

<p>A low table-land, of which the gradual slope takes a week
to ascend, separates the two rivers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>A chain of mountains, of which the highest peak is 6274
English feet above the level of the sea, extends to the S.W., joins
the ranges of Chantaboun, Pursak, and Thung Yai, which are
from 4000 to 5000 feet high, and reaches nearly to Komput and
Hatienne; while to the north another small chain, joining the
greater one of Korat, runs eastward, throws some ramifications
into the provinces of Battambong and Ongcor Borege, which is
40 miles farther north, and bears the name of the mountains of
Somrai.</p>

<p>Not being in direct communication with the Archæological
Society, I wish to call your attention to the marvellous remains
at Ongcor of the civilization of a great people.</p>

<p>The country is rich in woods and mines, and although thinly
populated, produces enough cotton for the use of Cochin China,
while the great lake, which abounds in fish, furnishes an immense
quantity of this article also to China. Iron of a superior
quality is also abundant, and the Kouis, an ancient tribe of a
primitive race, living east of the Mekon, who speak the same
language as the Stiêns, work it very industriously. There are
also many other mines, rich in gold, lead, and copper, in the
chains to the east and west; that of Pursak produces the beautiful
cardamom, which, when transplanted, gives fine stems but
no fruit.</p>

<p>Unluckily most of these mountains are frightfully unhealthy,
and no one but those who have lived there from infancy can
remain long among them with impunity.</p>

<p>In the island of Phu-Quor or Koh Trou, which belongs to
Cochin China, and which is very near to Komput, there are rich
mines of cannel coal. I was not able to get there, the war
having rendered the people hostile and cruel to all white men;
but my attention having been drawn to it by some ornaments
worked in this mineral by the islanders, I procured two specimens,
which I send you.</p>

<p>There are several extinct volcanoes in Pechaburi, four of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
which I have ascertained to form part of the numerous detached
and conical hills which are probably all ancient craters
belonging to the great chain Khao Deng, which occupies all the
northern part of the centre of the Malayan peninsula, and is inhabited
by the Kariens, a primitive and independent people, who,
like the Stiêns and other tribes, have doubtless been driven
back to the mountains by the encroachments of the Siamese,
and where the inclemency of the climate protects them against
all attacks from their neighbours. The mountains are known in
the country as the Na-Khou, Khao, Panom Knot, Khao Tamonne,
and Khao Samroum. The last two are 1700 and 1900
feet above the level of the sea, and only a few leagues distant
from each other. All these craters appear to have been originally
upheaved (“craters of elevation” M. de Buch styles
them) from the bottom of the water, at a period when all this
part of the country, as far as the great chain, which I have not
yet been able to visit, was under the sea.</p>

<p>Besides an immense volcanic cone, in part fallen in, and
where the ground resounds under one’s feet, each of the mounts
has several lateral mouths and a number of fissures and chimneys,
or passages, which bear evident traces of subterranean
fires. They are entirely composed of trachytic rocks, scoria,
lava, felspar, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Siamese have made temples of the largest of these
caverns, which are of great depth and breadth, and extremely
picturesque. One of the caverns of Samroum is quite inaccessible.
Having descended to the depth of 20 feet by a
chimney 2 feet wide at its mouth, and shut in between rocks, I
found myself at the entrance of a deep cavern, but there all
my efforts to proceed farther were defeated; a few steps from
the entrance my torch suddenly went out, my breathing was
checked, and I in vain fired my gun several times in order to
disperse the foul air.</p>

<p class="dateline">
Bangkok, 13th October, 1860.<br />
</p>

<p>To you, my dear brother, I address my last letter before
quitting Bangkok for my long journey to Laos. I have waited
till the last moment for the steamer which ought to bring me
letters from Europe, but unfortunately I am obliged to set out
without receiving any answers to those which I sent in May, on
my return from Cambodia. I fear that, once in the interior of
the country, I shall have no means of sending letters; arm yourself,
therefore, with patience, dear brother, and do not think me
neglectful if you do not receive any; but be sure that I, alone
in those profound solitudes, shall suffer more than you, from
my ignorance of everything concerning those dear to me; and
during the eighteen or twenty months which the journey will
probably occupy I shall not see a European face nor hear a
word which can recall to me my beloved country.</p>

<p>I have done everything in my power to obtain letters and
passports from the French and Siamese authorities here, but
all have been nearly useless. I have obtained nothing but a
letter from the King’s brother, who has the superintendence of
the provinces north of Laos, and with that I trust to be able to
get on. The good Dr. Campbell has supplied me with medicines
of all kinds, and as I am nearly acclimatized, and have with me
devoted followers&mdash;one particularly, Phrai, who would die for
me&mdash;you may be easy on my account. Besides, and I really
know not why, I have hitherto been much liked by the missionaries
and natives, and I am sure it will be the same there.
Fever does not kill all travellers. I have traversed many dangerous
districts in my journey to Cambodia, and I am safe.
Let us trust in God, my brother, that I shall be as fortunate
in this expedition, and that we shall meet again. Nothing is
requisite but courage, hope, and patience. I am sober, and
drink nothing but tea. My food is the same as that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
natives, dried fish and rice, and sometimes a little game which
I shoot, and roast on a spit after the fashion of the natives,
that is, by two bamboos stuck into the ground and another laid
horizontally on them, which is turned from time to time. My
amusements are hunting, arranging my collections, my drawings,
to which I devote a great deal of time, and of which some are
not bad, as you may judge by those sent to the Geographical
Society of London, and my journal; with those I pass many
pleasant hours. Besides, you know how I love nature, and am
only really happy in the woods with my gun, and that when
there, if I know you all to be happy, I have nothing to wish for.
I often think of our good old father, but as long as you are with
him I feel easy about him; you will make him bear my absence
patiently, repeat often to him how I love him, and how happy I
shall be when I can tell him about my long journeys. And
you, my brother, love and cherish your two dear children, my
little nephews; inculcate in them the love of nature, and teach
them to think that virtue is recompensed even here, and a good
conscience ennobles more than patents of nobility, or orders in
the button-hole; bring up your little ones in the love of God,
and of all that is good and great. Think and talk sometimes
with Jenny of the poor traveller. Adieu, my brother!</p>

<p class="dateline">
Khao Khoc, 21st December, 1861.
</p>

<p>An unexpected opportunity presents itself, my dear
Jenny, to send you a few words before proceeding farther. A
new year is about to commence: may you, my dear little sister,
experience in its course only joy and satisfaction; may your
interesting little family cause you unmixed happiness; in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
word, I desire every possible good for you. As for myself, I ask
nothing but the happiness of seeing you all again. Think occasionally
of the poor traveller whom every day removes farther
and farther from civilization, and who for eighteen months or
perhaps two years is about to live alone in a strange place, where
I shall not have even the consolation of meeting those good
missionaries as at Brelum and in Cambodia.</p>

<p>You know my manner of life, so I shall not repeat it. The
heat and the musquitoes make a real hell of this place. Those
who praise it must have hard heads and skins, or else must
be comfortably lodged, and surrounded by an army of slaves.
They know nothing but its enjoyments. If there is one pleasant
hour in the morning and another in the evening, one must think
oneself lucky, for often there is no peace night or day. My pleasures
are, first, liberty, that precious thing without which man
cannot be happy, and for which so many have fought and will
fight still; then, seeing so much that is beautiful, grand, and
new, and which no one has seen before me. From these I draw
my contentment. Thank God! my health is as good as when
I left you, although three years have passed over me.</p>

<p>Soon I shall be in Laos, and then, what strange things I shall
see daily! what curious beings I shall meet, to whom I shall be
equally an object of curiosity! I shall have delightful days,
then, perhaps, sad ones, if my servants have the fever, which
happens at intervals. If only to enliven these solitudes, I could
have you here, my dear Jenny, or if I could sing like you,
or even like a nightingale! Sometimes I do make use of my
falsetto voice, and hum the beautiful airs of Béranger, and
feel strengthened by the sublime odes of that great man of
genius.</p>

<p>Two or three thin volumes&mdash;I say thin, for the white ants
have eaten the greater part of them&mdash;and a few old newspapers
(new to me) compose my library; but I have blank paper,
which I fill as I best can; it is an amusement, at least; and if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
turn out of no other use than to serve to amuse you all, I shall
be satisfied, for I am not ambitious. I dream as I smoke my
pipe, for I must confess that I smoke more than ever.</p>

<p>Well! the musquitoes and thorns will still be my companions
for a long time. It is my own choice, and I shall never complain
as long as God grants to all of you the joy and happiness
I wish for you.</p>

<p>How I shall accomplish the long journey before me I know
not; probably with oxen and elephants; but if even I have to
go on foot I care not, so that I reach there, for I have determined
to drive away even the devil, should I meet him
here.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,
</p>

<p>This is the sixth letter I have written, and written on
my knees; and in this heat, and tormented by musquitoes, it is
an affair of as many days. Do not complain, therefore, if this
is short. Khao-Khoc is a mountain nine or ten leagues north
of Pakpriau, which I visited two years ago, and where I have
been waiting two months for the roads to become passable, in
order to reach Korat, and then Laos. I have made a fine collection
of coleoptera, particularly some remarkable longicorns.
I have but few shells or birds; nevertheless, the collection is
precious, and, although less numerous than the one at Pechaburi,
it is quite equal to it. I have been lucky enough to replace
a great part of the insects that were lost in the <i>Sir J.
Brooke</i>.</p>

<p>I remain perfectly well, but my two poor lads suffer from
time to time with intermittent fever; quinine, however, generally
stops it, and I hope the change of air will do them good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
The brave fellows do their work none the less cheerfully, and
they love me, and are quite devoted to me.</p>

<p>I am only waiting for the arrival of my letters, through
the medium of my good friend Dr. Campbell, to set out, because
when I have once started I fear none of your letters will reach
me.</p>

<p>I think I shall explore the Mekon, and go up as far as China,
if circumstances are favourable, and trust to bring back from
this journey many rare and precious things. I bought at Bangkok
many articles to give to those who shall aid me, such
as red and white cloth, brass wire, glass beads, needles,
spectacles, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>28th Dec.</i>&mdash;The night before my departure for Korat. All
the good news I have received from Europe and from Bangkok
has made me joyful. I have just received with your letters a
mass of papers. Every one is kind to me, and that is very
pleasant. My friend Malherbe has sent me some <i>caporal</i>, which
I had not enjoyed for a long time; he had just received some
from France, along with some pipes, and a precious extract of
sarsaparilla, invaluable for cooling the blood heated by the
climate, the food, and the troublesome musquitoes of which I
have spoken so often. I shall require another elephant to carry
all the red cloth sent to me by Mr. Adamson, and which will be
invaluable in Laos, as the people delight in it. I was moved
even to tears at so many marks of kindness from people who
hardly know me.</p>

</p>

<p>I have been three days at Korat, which is about 140
miles east-north-east of Pakpriau,&mdash;that is, nearly in the same
longitude as Battambong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>The journey, which I performed on foot, in company with a
caravan of 400 oxen carrying merchandise, lasted ten days,
from four in the morning to sunset, deducting only a few
hours in the middle of the day. My feet are in a bad state
from crossing the mountains, but, nevertheless, I enjoyed my
journey.</p>

<p>On these uplands, which are more than 4000 feet high, the air
is pure and pleasant, the nights are fresh, and the early morning
almost cold.</p>

<p>During these ten days I have collected but little, and my
expenses have been greater than I calculated on. Within the
last two years everything has doubled in price; but the governor
appears honest; he paid me a visit, which cost me a pair of spectacles,
some engravings, and other little things, but he has
promised me conveyances, and a letter to the chief of another
province, who will provide me with elephants.</p>

<p>My health is excellent, and I hope it will remain so; my servants
are better. I am surrounded by a crowd of curious
gazers, who fill up my hut.</p>

<p class="dateline">
Saraburi (Siam), 24th February, 1861.<br />
</p>

<p>You will be astonished, my dear friend, to see my letter
dated from Saraburi, instead of from Laos. When I reached
Chaiapume, I went to the governor with my letters, and asked
him to lend me elephants to enable me to continue my journey,
that being the only method of travelling among these mountains;
but he refused me decidedly, and consequently I have
been forced to retrace my steps. Here one can do nothing
without the help of the people in power.</p>

<p>I therefore returned to Korat, and established Phrai in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
hut which I hired of a Chinese; and went myself to Bangkok, to
procure from the authorities orders to the different governors
of provinces to aid me instead of throwing obstacles in my
way.</p>

<p>From Korat I had the pleasure of travelling with an amiable
mandarin of Bangkok, who had been to fetch a white elephant
from Laos, and who had conceived a great friendship for me.
He travelled in great style; the caravan was magnificent; we
had more than sixty elephants, two of which were placed at my
disposal, one for my own use, and one for my servants.</p>

<p>Finding myself in the good graces of this mandarin, I told
him why I was going to Bangkok, and he promised to obtain for
me all I wanted.</p>

<p>When I reached Saraburi I found all the governors of Laos
and the first mandarins of Bangkok assembled there to take care
of the white elephant. The Siamese, being very superstitious, and
believing in metempsychosis, think that the soul of some prince
or king has passed into the white elephant; they have the
same belief as to white apes and albinoes, consequently they
hold them all in great respect. They do not worship them,
for the Siamese recognise no God, not even Buddha, but they
believe that a white elephant brings luck to the country.</p>

<p>During the whole journey the men were busy cutting down
branches to make his passage easy; two mandarins fed him with
different kinds of cakes in golden dishes, and the King came
out to meet him.</p>

<p>I owe, therefore, to the white elephant the most satisfactory
letters which I have obtained, and which have cost me my best
gun and nearly 300 francs in presents; but I might have had
to give much more, and, as I am going to Bangkok, I can replenish
my stock. As for the poor elephant, he was so much
cared for and so well fed, that he died of indigestion.</p>

<p>It is a terrible affliction, and all the mandarins and other dignitaries
collected here are in great grief about it.</p>

<p class="dateline">
Saraburi, 24th February, 1861.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Annette</span>,</p>

<p>You will be much surprised on receiving this letter to
see it dated from Saraburi, for if you have received the one I
wrote in January, you must believe me to be already in Laos.
But man proposes, and God disposes. However, to reassure
you, I must begin by saying that I am in perfect health, and
full of strength and hope. All goes well with me.</p>

<p>I had in fact reached Laos. I arrived at Korat after a tedious
and troublesome journey, for I had only a few oxen for my
baggage, and was forced to walk myself. From there I went
to Chaiapume, and here an animal of the mandarin species
made himself great, and under the pretext of having no elephants
refused me the means of going further, and was so rude
and impolite to me that I determined at once to return and
protest against the very insufficient protection which had been
granted to me. Indeed, I could do nothing else, not being able
to go on. The elephant which had brought me to Chaiapume
took me back to Korat, and there I found a mandarin from
Bangkok, who had been sent to fetch a white elephant which
had been taken in Laos. I begged him to let me join his party,
and he lent me two elephants, one for my servant and luggage,
and one for myself. I left Phrai at Korat, with the greater
part of my possessions, having hired a room for him in the
house of a Chinese, and a week afterwards found myself back
at Saraburi, in company with this strange divinity (who, by
the way, had more black than white about him), and of the
grand personage who had been sent to escort him, and who
had showered on him every kind of attention during the journey.
He had an escort of fifty foot soldiers and several on
horseback. As for me, I wanted for nothing; at every halt the
mandarin sent me ducks, fish, fruit, sweetmeats, &amp;c., and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
also kind enough to allow me eight men as night-guards to
watch round my fire. In return, I discovered for him in the
mountains large quantities of copper, and even gold, which
delighted him.</p>

<p>The whole province of Saraburi was in motion to do honour
to the white elephant; the King and all his court are coming
here; the ministers are here already to watch over him. I
decided, therefore, to apply to the Siamese, hoping to obtain
more from them than from the Europeans; and yesterday,
hearing of the arrival of Khrom Luang, the King’s brother, I
hastened to address myself to him. He, however, had only
passed through, and was gone to Prabat, to join the King.
However, I found here the man I wanted, the mandarin who has
most interest in Laos, and without a letter from whom it would
have been difficult to proceed. I did not know him, but I went
to him to ask about the Prince, and told him what I wanted.
“I am your man,” said he; “the Prince can only give an order
for me to write a letter, such as I will give you, if you like.”
I accepted gladly, and promised him in return my double-barrelled
gun, which I could easily replace, “if he would only
furnish me with the means of travelling through Laos without
expense, and would bring the Chaiapume mandarin to reason.”
The poor governor of Saraburi was with us, and had to remain
more than an hour amidst a number of others kneeling on the
bare ground, while I was seated on the mat of the mandarin, by
his side, eating sweetmeats and drinking tea, while he dictated a
letter in which he called the governor of Chaiapume a fool, and
threatened to deprive him of his office, and of this letter I was
to be the bearer; and he promised me another general one on
the morrow, in which he stated that if I did not receive efficient
aid it might bring on a war; and this he also repeated to all
the chiefs present. My cause was gained, and I could plainly
see that our affairs must be going on well in Cochin China; the
echo of the cannon had its effect in Siam. However, I had pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>mised
him my gun, and evidently he wished to have it before he
gave me the letters. This morning, therefore, I took it to him
all cleaned and furbished up. He was delighted with it, and gave
me at once the letter for Korat and Chaiapume, and to-morrow I
am to have one which will carry me all through Laos without any
expense but a few ticals to the cornacs. Without this, judging by
what I had to pay for an elephant from Korat to Chaiapume, my
purse would have been exhausted by the time I reached the
north of Laos, and I should not have had the means of returning
without sending to Bangkok to ask for help, which would have
been a work of difficulty, and, what is worse, I should have been
exposed all along the route to the insolence of these arrogant
mandarins. Now, they will all humble themselves before me,
taking me for some important personage sent by the Emperor
Napoleon or Queen Victoria to collect butterflies, insects, and
birds for them. I shall no longer travel on foot, but on
elephants, and shall want for nothing. Agree, then, with me,
that out of evil comes good, or rather, that God does all for the
best. When at Chaiapume I found myself obliged to retrace my
steps, after so many fatigues, and so great a waste of money, I
was only downcast for a few minutes; God almost immediately
inspired me with the idea that all would turn to my advantage,
and this persuasion never left me again. Unaccountably to myself,
I was gayer on my return than I had been in coming,
although then I was everywhere well received and kindly
treated by the people. Even after my discourteous reception
at Chaiapume, all the inhabitants came to see me, to bring me
little presents, and to express their regret that they could not
aid me from fear of their chief. The head of the monastery
took me to see some ruins similar to those in Cambodia, and
gave me a tiger-skin; and all along the road I experienced the
same kindness, and numbers came to me to ask for advice and
various remedies.</p>

<p>The Chinese are all my friends. When I returned to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
town, you should have seen them all run out to see me, and
those at whose houses I had stopped were full of inquiries as to
my affairs, and crying out “Ah! here is the gentleman back
again.” The next day would be their New Year’s Day, which
they keep as a feast as we do Christmas. “I have come back to
feast with you to-morrow,” replied I; and the next day I was so
loaded with cakes and other good things that I have not finished
them yet.</p>

<p>You must arm yourself with patience, dear Annette, for I
have not yet finished. I learned this morning that a French
ship of war is at Paknam, I presume for the purpose of taking
back the Siamese Ambassador who has been so long expected in
France. The king must be delighted, for he has a great dread
of any quarrel with France or England now that he has seen
their power. They may very probably come here, and at the
risk of losing three days I shall wait and see, for, doubtless, the
officer would receive me well, and do more for me than the
Consul did. After that, I shall go to Bangkok, where I shall
remain only a day, in order to buy a few necessaries in which I
was beginning to run short, such as camphor, shoes, cloth, and a
gun, and to get a little money, 50 or 100 ticals, from M. Adamson,
who will willingly advance it to me, as he promised; and
above all, to receive all the dear letters from home, of which a
number must be lying at Dr. Campbell’s.</p>

<p>My useless voyage to Chaiapume diminished my resources,
and it would be great pity that the want of a few hundred francs
should force me to return before I have completed my journey,
and before I have finished collecting what will amply repay all
my expenses.</p>

<p>In a few days I will add a line to this letter to tell you the
result of my interview with the officer, and of my journey to
Bangkok. I shall hear news also from your letters; let them
only be good, and I shall be happy. I must now close my letter
for to-day, my dear Annette; some day you will see my journal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and read all my adventures in detail. I can write no more to-day,
but only repeat my assurance that I am perfectly well, in
spite of all trials, thanks to my prudence and sobriety. Show
this letter or anything that is interesting in it to all friends. I
speak only of my own affairs, but you know I am not changed.
And yet a few words of love would doubtless be more prized
by you, but were I to write a thousand I could not express
half the love with which my heart is filled for you all; indeed
I fear to begin, for that would have no end. I write all this on
my knees; my back aches, and now I must go and seek some
repose. Au revoir! I trust soon to send you still better news
than this. I embrace you a thousand times from the bottom of
my heart, as well as all those dear to us, and am ever</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My very dear Annette</span>,</p>

<p>I reached Korat two days ago, and in four more I hope
to be able to proceed northward. I have been obliged to travel
on foot, not having been able to procure elephants at Saraburi;
my baggage was carried by oxen. I feel perfectly well,
and experience so little fatigue that on the day of my arrival
here I walked about till evening.</p>

<p>I write you these few lines only to set your mind at ease,
for&mdash;surrounded from morning till night by curious gazers
who have never before seen a European&mdash;it would be difficult
to enter into details, but, in truth, my journey furnished but
few. I travelled with Laotians, and found them very kind; in
a few days I shall be in the heart of their country, and think I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>

letter will be short, but I have little to tell since I wrote last;
when I am quietly settled in some little hut in the midst of a

as it would cost me 9 ticals, and take several days, and I shall
be obliged to be excessively economical. Yesterday I had a
visit from a mandarin, the viceroy of the province. He was very

<p class="dateline">
Louang Prabang (Laos), 23rd July, 1861.<br />
</p>

<p>Now, my dear Jenny, let us converse together. Do
you know of what I often think when every one around me is
asleep, and I, lying wrapped in my mosquito-curtains, let my
thoughts wander back to all the members of my family? Then
I seem to hear again the charming voice of my little Jenny,
and to be listening once more to ‘La Traviata,’ ‘The Death of
Nelson,’ or some other of the airs that I loved so much to
hear you sing. I then feel regret, mingled with joy, at the
souvenirs of the happy&mdash;oh, how happy!&mdash;past. Then I open
the gauze curtains, light my pipe, and gaze out upon the stars,
humming softly the ‘Pâtre’ of Béranger, or the ‘Old Sergeant,’
and thinking that one day I may return Corporal or Sergeant
of the battalion of Naturalists.</p>

<p>Perhaps all this does not interest you, but you may feel
sure that I do not forget you nor your children; so let me,
my dear child, talk to you as we used to talk in the old times
as we sat by the fire. When shall we do so again?</p>

<p>In another year, or perhaps two, dear Jenny, I shall think
of returning to you all for some time. Shall you be very angry,
my dear little sister, when I say that it will be with regret?&mdash;for
I should wish to visit the whole of the mountains that I
can see from my window. I say “window,” but here such a
luxury is unknown: I live in a shed without either doors or
windows&mdash;a room open to every wind.</p>

<p>I would wish, I repeat, to cross the whole network of mountains
which extend northward, see what lies beyond them, visit
China or Thibet, and see the Calmucks or the Irkoutsk. But,
alas! I cannot trust my dear insects. I say “my dear insects”
as you would say “my dear children” to the king of Louang
Prabang.</p>

<p>How does all go on at Jersey?&mdash;for I hope that you are still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
there. Your children form your happiness, and you can dispense
easily with travelling, or with those people commonly
called “friends”&mdash;nothing is so general as the name, or so
rare as the reality&mdash;and you are right; yet I consider a true
friend as a real treasure. I may be wrong, for man is so constituted
as always to long for what he has not, but I wish I
had friends around me here; these places, now often gloomy,
would please me more.</p>

<p>I hoped that at the king’s return I should have the happiness
of hearing from you; but I am told that his journey will occupy
a year, and before that time I shall be away from here.</p>

<p>I hope, my little friend, that all is well with you. Embrace
your dear children for me, and talk to them sometimes about
their uncle “Barberousse,” who often thinks of them in this
distant land, and is collecting stories for their amusement on
his return. Ask <span class="lock">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> what I shall bring him&mdash;a monkey, a
sabre to cut off <span class="lock">M&mdash;&mdash;’s</span> dolls’ heads&mdash;no, that would give him
warlike ideas, and I do not like our modern soldiers&mdash;or a
tiger-skin for a carpet. I have several. And your pretty little
<span class="lock">M&mdash;&mdash;</span>, will she have an ape, a fan, some Chinese slippers
(for she must have feet which would be small even in China),
some marabout feathers, or a cane to keep her brothers in
order?</p>

<p>Adieu, adieu! Au revoir! Do not forget me.</p>

<p class="dateline">
Laos, Louang Prabang, 27th July, 1861.<br />
</p>

<p>During my journey through the forests I enjoyed in
anticipation the pleasure I should enjoy on reaching Louang
Prabang, the capital of the province of Laos, in writing you
good long letters containing all details of my journey; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
I reckoned without my host, and it will be several weeks
before I can enjoy any repose, or carry my wishes into
execution.</p>

<p>In the villages through which I passed no great degree
of curiosity was manifested; but here, where the population is
greater, I am surrounded by a compact and curious crowd,
which extends even to the walls of a pagoda adjoining the
caravanserai where I am lodged by the favour of his Majesty
the King. Besides, I, in my turn, see people of various nations
and tribes who excite my curiosity. Judge, therefore, if it be
easy to collect my ideas. However, I profit by the occasion
of the king’s departure for Bangkok in a few days to pay his
tribute, and who has offered to take charge of any letters for
me, to give some signs of life to you.</p>

<p>You will be happy to hear that I have accomplished this
troublesome journey satisfactorily, without the loss of a single
man, and without any personal illness. Indeed, my health has
been very good, which is more than I can say for my servants,
who are so kind and devoted to me. I am even astonished at
myself, having gone through the mountainous district which
separates the basin of the Menam from that of the Mekon, a
place much dreaded by the Siamese, and covered with virgin-forests
like those of Dong Phya Phia, without having had a
single touch of fever, or, indeed, any indisposition, with the
exception of <i>migraine</i>, caused by the heat of the sun, and having
my feet in a very bad state.</p>

<p>I bless God for the favour granted to me of having accomplished
these perilous journeys, and trust wholly to His goodness
for the future.</p>

<p>I am now more than 250 leagues north of the place where
two years ago I first drank the waters of the Mekon. This
immense stream, which is larger here than the Menam at
Bangkok or the Thames below London Bridge, flows between
high mountains with the rapidity of a torrent, tearing up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
rainy season the trees along the banks, and breaking with a
noise like that of a stormy sea against the rocks, which form
a number of frightful rapids.</p>

<p>I arrived here only the day before yesterday, after a journey
of four months and ten days; but I stopped in several places,
for I often found fields ready to cut in the rice-grounds that
the mountaineers cultivate on the slopes of the mountains, and
when the crops are cut down insects abound.</p>

<p>My collections made during the journey are very valuable
and beautiful, and I have a great number of new species, both
entomological and conchological, with which, if they only reach
London in safety, our friends will be delighted. All the beautiful
kinds that I was asked for, but which elsewhere are so
rare that with great trouble I was only able to procure one or
two specimens, I have now in great abundance, and also many
new sorts. Here I hope to do still better.</p>

<p>They are all savages in this province, and I have just
received a visit from two young princes remarkable for their
stupidity.</p>

<p>I have suffered little from the heat, in spite of the season,
which is easy to understand, as I have been always amidst thick
forests or on mountains. In the valleys the air is heavy, and
the heat overwhelming; but everywhere the nights were so
fresh that my wraps were useful and almost indispensable. In
a few months we shall probably want fire. I prefer this
climate to that of the South; there are few mosquitoes (that
plague of the tropics and especially of Siam) in comparison
with other places&mdash;indeed, in some of these parts I have not
found any.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Governor of Korat, who gave me an excellent
letter to the mandarins, I have travelled at little expense;
without it, I should have paid much more, and have suffered
every kind of inconvenience. Everywhere I have been furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
with elephants (as many as seven in some provinces), an escort,
guard, and plenty of provisions.</p>

<p>I had this morning an audience of the great body of State
Mandarins, like the House of Peers with us. Twenty of them
were assembled in a vast caravanserai, and presided over by
the eldest prince. You may form some idea of the dignity
of these gentlemen by the drawing which I will send to
you.</p>

<p>My plan is to pass six or eight months of the good season in
the neighbouring villages, in order to complete my collection,
and next January or March I will try to go north or east, where
I shall pass a few more months amidst the Laotian tribes.
Probably I shall go no farther, for China would be a barrier to
me on the north, and Cochin China on the east. I shall then
return here, and go down the Mekon in July or August, 1862,
the time when the waters are high, and shall thus reach Korat
in a few weeks. I am yet uncertain whether I shall stop there,
whether I shall explore the eastern part of the river, or whether
I shall go to Cambodia. All my movements depend upon
circumstances that may arise. I shall try to profit by all that
are favourable, and that will contribute to give interest to my
journey.</p>

<p>Do not be anxious when you think of your poor friend the
traveller, for you know that up to the present time everything
has prospered with him: and truly I experience a degree of
contentment, strength of soul, and internal peace, which I have
never known before.</p>

Louang Prabang, 8th August, 1861.<br />
</p>

<p>No event could have caused more sensation here than the
arrival of “the long-bearded stranger.” From the humblest to
the greatest&mdash;for even here are distinctions of rank&mdash;every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
looks on a “white” as a natural curiosity, and they are not yet
satisfied with looking&mdash;nothing is talked of but the stranger.
When I pass through the town in my white dress, to go to the
market or to visit the pagodas or other interesting places,
the people crowd round me, and look after me as long as they
can catch a glimpse of me. Everywhere I go complete silence
reigns, and I am treated as though I were a sovereign or prince,
and the council, by order of the king, have given to me as to
them power of life or death over his subjects. Poor people!
why can I not raise you from the abasement into which you
have fallen&mdash;I am overwhelmed with presents of all kinds in
return for the slightest favour shown to these unfortunate
people. They seem to me some of the most to be pitied that I
have seen; even the women and children are opium-eaters:
they might really be called a nation of cretins.</p>

<p>The heat is greater here than any I have felt; when the sun
shines, and there has been no rain for several days, I find it
worse than at Bangkok; still the nights are generally pleasant,
and from the month of December to the end of March I am
told that it is really cold.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">To M. Charles Mouhot.</span></h4>

<p class="dateline">
Louang Prabang, West Laos, 27th July, 1861.<br />
</p>

<p>As you will have the opportunity, my dear brother, of
reading my other letters, I shall not write to you at length;
but, nevertheless, I must give you some details as to my journey
to Laos, although I cannot tell whether the crowd of curious
gazers around me will permit me to write as I would wish; if
not, you must blame them and not me.</p>

<p>On the 10th April I wrote you from Korat, and I think you
must also have received a message which I sent to you by a
good and honest Chinese, who has been very useful to me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
from whom I have received more help and kindness than from
any other of the mandarins.</p>

<p>I was not then in good spirits, for I doubted whether I
should be able to accomplish the journey for which I had
already suffered so many annoyances, one of which was having
to return to Korat to procure more useful letters than those
which I had taken with me on starting. At last I obtained
one from the Viceroy of Korat, which was the only one of
service to me, and which sufficed to secure me aid and protection
during my whole journey to Laos.</p>

<p>From Korat to Bangkok you know that I travelled in company
with an animal who has a title equal to that of the greatest
Siamese mandarin, and who was served by two inferior mandarins,
who gave him his meals composed of cakes, biscuits,
and sweetmeats out of golden dishes; and who had slaves sent
before him to clear the way and cut down the brushwood and
branches, for this elephant, according to the Siamese superstition
and ignorance, possesses the soul of some deceased prince or
king. They called him a white elephant, but in reality he had
only a few spots of that colour on his body. Alas! The king
and all his mandarins are now in mourning, for the object
of their worship died of indigestion. Poor beast and poor
king!</p>

<p>I have travelled a long way since I last wrote, and God has
protected me. I crossed the mountains and went through the
most dreaded jungles in the rainy season without losing a
man, and without having suffered myself. My travelling expenses
were comparatively small to what they might have
been; everywhere I was furnished gratis with elephants, escorts,
guards, and provisions (rice and fowls), as though I were an
envoy from the king, and all this owing solely to a letter from
the Viceroy of Korat.</p>

<p>I have made a good collection of coleoptera, and have
procured a number of excessively rare and beautiful species.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
I have also obtained some very rare and interesting conchological
specimens. As for animals, I have but few; some
monkeys and a good many serpents.</p>

<p>In a week I shall be settled in a new place, where I intend
to spend four or five months, and by the end of the year I
trust to have 4000 insects.</p>

<p>The Mekon is a large and beautiful stream, full of rocks,
which form frightful rapids in the rainy season. I shall descend
it at the season when the waters are high, and when the
navigation though dangerous is easy and rapid. I can then
reach Cambodia in a month if I like, but I am undecided
whether or not I shall go eastward towards the 15th degree of
latitude.</p>

<p>It seems to me, my dear brother, that my happiness would
be complete if I could have good news of you all; but, alas!
more than a year must elapse before I shall hear. The last
letters I received were in January; yet I am resigned, since
I willingly embraced this career, which has been the dream of
my whole life, for you remember how in our young days, when
we still had the happiness of a tender mother to guide us, and
impress on us, by her example, virtuous principles, religion, and
the love of mankind, we delighted to roam the woods of our
dear native place, to draw from nature, and how I stuffed the
birds that we took in snares or nets.</p>

<p>That time is long passed, my friend, but I trust in God, who
will I hope watch over you. I think of you every day in my
solitude, and in the long nights when we bivouac beside the fires
lighted to keep off the wild beasts, a scene of which I will send
you a drawing before long.</p>

<p>What are your dear children doing&mdash;I picture to myself all
the happiness they give you and your dear Jenny; she is well I
hope. Ah! my friend, protect them all with a tender affection,
and endeavour by your love, your care, and your example, to
render them all happy and good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one subject on which I can hardly write, that of our
dear old father; it would make me too sad to think he was not
happy; console him for my absence, write to him often, repeat
to him how much I love him, that he is always associated in my
thoughts with the memory of our good and worthy mother. But
I have no need to recommend all this to you: have you not ever
been good to him, a worthy son? therefore I am without anxiety
on this point.</p>

<p>I do not speak to you of any of my physical sufferings, for I
hold mental ones to be the only ones worth thinking of; but
you may imagine that one cannot make a four months’ journey
on elephants, who toss and shake one like a stormy sea, without
fatigue, and that the heat, the long bad nights generally passed
at the foot of some tree, and the wretched food, are all painful.
But what matters all this? I am used to it, and my patience is
inexhaustible. In truth, this life is happiness to me; how joyful
I am when I find a new insect, or see a monkey fall from a
tree! I do not therefore complain. The nights here are pleasant,
and the mosquitoes not numerous.</p>

<p>The men of this nation are dull and apathetic and full of
small vices. The women are generally better, and some of them
are even pretty in spite of their yellow skins, but they have
little idea of modesty. The men and women all bathe together
without any clothing. But for the people, Louang Prabang
would be one of the most charming places in the world: the
lake of Geneva does not present scenes more beautiful than
many here by the river.</p>

<p>After waiting for ten days I have at length been presented to
the king with great pomp. The reception room was a shed
such as they build in our villages on fête-days, but larger and
hung with every possible colour. His Majesty was enthroned
at one end of the hall, lazily reclining on a divan, having on
his right hand four guards squatting down, and each holding a
sabre: behind were the princes all prostrated, and farther off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
senators, with their backs to the public and their faces in the
dust; then in front of his Majesty was your poor brother,
dressed all in white, and seated on a carpet, with teacups,
basins, and spittoons in silver placed by his side, contemplating
this grotesque scene, and having some trouble to preserve his
gravity as he smoked his pipe. This visit cost me a gun for
the king and various small presents for the princes, for one
cannot travel here without being well furnished with presents
for the kings, princes, and mandarins. Luckily it is not here
as in Siam; the natives are willing to help me, and for a few
inches of brass wire I get a beautiful longicorn or some other
insect, and these are brought to me on all sides: thus I have
succeeded in largely increasing my collection, but five pieces of
red cloth have disappeared already.</p>

<p>The day after my first audience I had another from the
second king, who wished also for a present. I sought among my
stock, which anywhere else would cause me to be taken for a
dealer in old stores, and found a magnifying glass and a pair of
old-fashioned spectacles with round glasses, which make him
look like a gorilla without hair, a little cake of soap (he had
great need of it), a bottle of eau-de-cologne, and a bottle of
brandy. This last was opened on the spot and duly appreciated.
You see all this is expensive, but I am obliged to
pay these good people, and the king has been kind to me, and
is going to carry my letters for me. It is lucky that he does
not understand French; for if at Bangkok the same system of
postal curiosity was carried on as was established in Europe by
the great king who betrayed La Vallière, I should be hung from
the highest tree they could find, without even a warning. I
afterwards distributed among the princes some engravings
which I had bought at Bangkok&mdash;fine Cossack cavalry, lance in
rest; some Napoleons (the First), for which I gave a penny; and
some battles of Magenta, portraits of Victor Emmanuel and of
Garibaldi, very white, blue, and red, and some Zouaves; also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
some brass-headed nails and some brandy; and it was quite
pleasing to see how delighted they were, regretting only that I
should go away before I had given them my whole stock.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Stevens</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>Being entirely cut off from all communication with
Bangkok, from which I am nearly 700 miles distant, is the
only reason why you have not heard from me for so long a
time.</p>

<p>In January last I quitted the Siamese province of Saraburi,
where during four months I had been making active
exertions in order to enable me to penetrate into Western Laos,
and to explore the basin of the Mekon. Unluckily in March
I was forced, after having at great expense proceeded 350
miles, to return to Bangkok, in order to claim more assistance
and protection than had hitherto been accorded to me, and a
passport to counteract the difficulties continually thrown in my
way by the mandarins, a class not less jealous and greedy here
than in China. A letter of recommendation which had been
voluntarily given to me (on my departure in October, 1860)
by the Khrôme Louang Wougsâ, who is considered to be the
prince best disposed towards Europeans in all Siam, and who
has the superintendence of all the country which I intended
to visit, turned out after all to be only a kind of letter of
Bellerophon’s. In spite of all my entreaties and valuable
presents I obtained nothing better; still I set off again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>I have passed three times through the forest of the Dong Phya
Phia, which separates Korat from the ancient Siamese provinces
of the south and east. This thick jungle covers a space of
thirty miles in breadth,&mdash;that is to say, the chain of mountains
which separates the basin of the Mekon from that of the
Menam.</p>

<p>After passing the mountains you reach a sandy and generally
arid plain, where nothing is to be seen but resinous trees of
stunted growth, bamboos, underwood, and sometimes only grass;
but in some places a richer soil permits cultivation, and there
fields of rice and bananas have been established. I found in this
district both oligist and magnetic iron.</p>

<p>In the bed of a torrent I also discovered gold and copper in
two different places. This district is rich and abundant in
precious minerals, neglected or unknown until now, except by
a small tribe of 400 or 500 Kariens, without doubt a remnant of
the aborigines, who a short time ago, in order to preserve their
independence, retired into almost inaccessible places, thirty or
forty miles eastward of the tracts traversed by the caravans.
Monkeys, panthers, elephants, and other wild beasts are the
only inhabitants of this mountain, which the natives regard as
the abode of death on account of its insalubrity.</p>

ancient Cambodians), still surrounds the town. It is at present
governed by a Siamese mandarin of the first class, a kind of
viceroy, but the ancient inhabitants have nearly disappeared, and
it contains only about 300 Chinese or their descendants, small
resident merchants, 300 other individuals who go about the
country trading, and 1500 or 2000 Laotians, Cambodians, and
Siamese, who, like wolves or jackals which follow an army or
caravan, have come there from all parts of the kingdom, or
have remained there after the wars of Laos and Cambodia, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
order to lead a life in harmony with their inclinations, attacking
travellers and Chinese merchants, in fact a hand of miscreants,
with few exceptions destitute of all good qualities.</p>

<p>In the environs are two temples, which would do honour to
the founders of the Cambodian edifices: one of them is in good
preservation, and of this I have made a drawing. The style,
architecture, and workmanship are all alike; one would say that
the same artists and workmen had drawn the plans and executed
them. Again you see those immense blocks, beautifully cut,
joined without cement, and covered with carving and bas-reliefs.</p>

<p>One of these temples is situated about thirty miles from the
town, and is said to have been founded by a Queen; the other,
nine miles to the east, is supposed to have been built by the
King her husband. Much farther east it is said that there are
others containing beautiful sculptures, but I have not been able
to visit them, as they are out of my route.</p>

<p>Want of means for the easy and advantageous removal of
merchandise, causes Korat to be the central market for all the
eastern part of the country. There they bring all the silk of
Laos, langoutis, skins, horns, ivory, peacocks’ tails, &amp;c., which
the active Chinese merchants sell again at a good profit at
Bangkok, notwithstanding all the taxes they have to pay, having
brought from thence cotton and other useful articles of Chinese
and European manufacture for the use of the natives. Thus
there passes daily through the forest of Dong Phya Phia, on the
average, a caravan of from 100 to 150 oxen. With protective
instead of restrictive laws, and an enlightened and civilized
government, this commerce would increase threefold in a very
short time.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the small population of Korat, it is the chief
town of a province, or rather an extensive state, containing
eleven towns or boroughs, chief towns of districts, and a great
number of villages, more or less populated. Fifteen days’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
journey brings you from Korat to Bassac on the banks of the
Mekon, and in the same latitude.</p>

<p>My intention was to proceed northwards, only stopping in the
province of Louang Prabang, and then to descend the river as
far as Cambodia. I hired elephants, and five days after, having
passed through several villages inhabited by the descendants of
ancient Siamese colonists who had taken refuge there in time of
war, passing continually through forests of resin trees thinly
scattered, I arrived at Ban Prang, a village where I discovered
a ruined tower, and also the remains of an ancient temple. The
next place I arrived at was Chaiapoune, the principal Laotian
town in the north, and the chief town of the district. Here also
I found ruins; but they were inconsiderable, and seemed more
like a Laotian imitation than the work of Khmer Dôme. The
inscriptions on the other temples in the province of Korat
resemble those of Ongcor: here I found upon a block of broken
slate-stone an inscription in Laotian characters, but which is
unintelligible even to the inhabitants of the country. These,
with some remains of idols and towers at the foot of a mountain
in the district, were the only vestiges of that ancient civilization
which I discovered in the north. Everything leads me to
suppose that here also were the limits which separated the
kingdom of Cambodia from that of Vieng Thiane, destroyed
during the last war which the Siamese raised against the Western
Laotians or <i>white-bellies</i>. It was in this district that I was
stopped in my travels by the authorities of the country, who
treated me with great rudeness, and who forbade the people to
let me have any means of transport, even after seeing my passport.
I was therefore obliged to retrace my steps, deploring the
expense and loss of time in the best part of the year, and which
will cause me serious inconvenience.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">From M. Guilloux.</span></h4>

<p class="dateline">
Brelum, among the Stiêns, 12th August, 1859.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear M. Mouhot</span>,</p>

<p>It must be allowed that you have plenty of courage;
and before knowing you, I feel a strong interest in you; indeed,
I feel as though I loved you already. You will be very
welcome, and must share pot-luck with me, like a brother, will
you not? I trust you will not be scandalized at any of our
ways; for among the savages we live in rather an uncivilized
fashion. But with good hearts all will go well.</p>

<p>Your servant Nhu arrived yesterday among the Stiêns at
Brelum, quite tired with the journey, and with his feet in a
sad state. A few days’ rest, however, will restore him. He
looks to me like a good fellow. You may be sure we shall take
care of him, as well as of your little Chinese when he arrives.</p>

<p>You must never trust to the word of a Cambodian, dear
M. Mouhot; they are terrible boasters.</p>

<p>You are two long days’ journey from us, and will have to
pass one night in the forest. We will try to send you one or
two vehicles. These, with a good covering and a fire, will
preserve you from injury from the night air. You say, too, that
you are accustomed to sleep on the ground; it is well to be able
to do everything.</p>

<p>Unluckily, my feet are very bad just now, or I should have
been delighted to come and meet you. I will send the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
carriages&mdash;carriages! wretched carts rather! There will be
an Annamite seminarist to lead the caravan; he is a good fellow,
and clever at that kind of work. You can talk to him in
Latin. Two of the carts are drawn by oxen, and one by buffaloes;
but if they are not enough to bring your luggage, ask the
Cambodians boldly for more, and show them your letter from
the king.</p>

<p>Our carts will arrive one day after the return of the Cambodians;
when you arrive I will explain why. I trust that will be
soon. I wish you a good journey. Keep your gun loaded, for
animals of all kinds abound. But you will find here warm hearts,
patriotism, and, above all, no ceremony.</p>

<p class="dateline">
Pinhalú, Cambodia.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear M. Mouhot</span>,</p>

<p>I think of you in your peregrinations, and I feel sure
that you must meet with many obstacles and difficulties; but
with patience, perseverance, and help from on high, a great deal
may be done.</p>

<p>As for myself, I have not got rid of my atony&mdash;for such is
my illness. At first I obtained some relief by means of opium
as an astringent and quinine as a tonic, and by great attention
to diet, living almost wholly on broth; a piece of meat, or
even an egg, throws me back for a week.</p>

<p>M. Guilloux set off in good health on the 9th January. He
tells me that you have promised to go and see his relations when
you return to France.</p>

<p>I shall never forget, dear M. Mouhot, the pleasure that I
experienced in the few days that I passed in your society; such
days are so rare in our missionary life.</p>

<p>All is quiet just now in Cambodia; the forts or redoubts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
are guarded only by a few men. Mgr. Miche is expected
to return from Komput about the end of March. Shall I be so
happy as to receive news of you? It would give me great
pleasure, and recall that which I have already experienced in our
meeting in this life. Let us hope to be re-united, no more to
part, in a happier one.</p>

<p>Pray receive my kindest remembrances, and believe me,
dear M. Mouhot,</p>

Singapore, 29th May, 1860.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My very dear Friend, M. Mouhot</span>,</p>

<p>Your two kind and welcome letters, one from Battambong
on the 7th March, and the other from Bangkok on the 3rd
May, reached me when I was about three days’ distance from
Singapore, where I had gone for my health, and which I reached
in April, after having passed the whole month of March in
Bangkok.</p>

<p>I must tell you that MM. Arnoux and Guilloux have been
able to buy five or six little savage children, and that they now
meet with a little more kindness from the natives than they did.
When France shall reign in Cochin China, and the natives can
shake off the yoke of the Cambodians, it is to be hoped that they
will be better disposed towards religion. The king has already
discovered the mistake he made in attacking the Annamites,
who may fall upon him without dread of the French. Mgr.
Miche thinks that the daily flight of the Cambodian soldiers
will avoid new provocation, and that the war may not take
place; but every one is on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i>. The king has sent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
letter to ask for silence on the part of M. Miche. They are
fawning curs now; but on the slightest return of good fortune,
their arrogance will be redoubled.</p>

<p>You gave me much pleasure, dear M. Mouhot, by your promise
to visit my family at Laval. If you go near there, I shall
expect no less from your kindness.</p>

<p>I hope to see you again, either at Singapore or at Saigon,
before your return to Europe. May the good God guide your
steps and preserve your life in this country, where death finds
so many victims! I beg it through the intercession of our common
mother.</p>

<p>Believe in my cordial friendship.</p>

Among the Stiêns at Brelum, 1st October, 1860.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear M. Mouhot</span>,</p>

<p>I received your welcome letter of the 4th May, and it
is impossible to tell you the pleasure it gave me. I was much
pleased to hear that you were still in good health. May the
good God aid and bless your efforts, and send you home safe
and well to your family and country!</p>

<p>I sympathize sincerely with you in your disappointment at
not meeting at Bangkok with more kindness among those from
whom you had a right to expect aid and protection, and who are
paid well for that purpose. Alas! how weak we all are when
we rely for aid only on men like ourselves. But you, dear M.
Mouhot, do not do so; you know how to seek support from a
higher source; and while you remain the submissive child of
God, be sure He will not abandon you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>I went to Pinhalú last month, and brought back a young
Annamite with me, but the poor fellow died.</p>

<p>You see I can travel; but I am not strong. I have been
often ill since your departure; and M. Arnoux is going this time
to undertake the journey to Cambodia. May God bring him
back safe and well!</p>

<p>The affairs of Cochin China are very bad; debauchery and
infamy are rife at Saigon. So many crimes cannot bring a
blessing on the colony.</p>

<p>No news from China.</p>

<p>Adieu, dear M. Mouhot. Believe me ever one of your most
faithful friends,</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">From Dr. Campbell</span>, R.N.</h4>

<p class="dateline">
Bangkok, 15th Dec. 1860.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. Mouhot</span>,</p>

<p>Your letters of the 30th October and 20th November
were duly delivered to me on the 12th instant. I was naturally
rejoiced to find you continue in good health and spirits; and I
sincerely trust you will be able, on each occasion you write, to
give me a like favourable account.</p>

<p>Since you left there has been little or no change in Bangkok,
the only domestic item I have to communicate being the recent
marriage of Dr. Brady’s eldest daughter to one of the missionaries
named M’Gilvary, who used to stay with Dr. House.</p>

<p>Only one European letter has arrived for you, but I enclose
others from Mr. Wilson and Mr. Adamson, and, by the way,
some newspapers from him and M. Malherbe. The latter will
probably write to you; if so, I shall enclose his letter. The
box from Europe also accompanies this letter. Luckily it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
arrived in time; but I only received it yesterday. I forward
you the evening mails just arrived by last vessel. I could send
you all that have come to hand since you left; but as it is a
voluminous paper, it would take up much space, and you might
not care to wade through all of them, in spite of the stirring
events in Europe. Garibaldi, you will perceive, has liberated
Sicily, and all but done likewise for the Neapolitan kingdom.
The King of Naples left his capital without firing a shot; but
made a stand at Capua, where his Neapolitans and mercenaries
made a determined though ineffectual resistance. The King
of Sardinia in the mean time has invaded the Marches, and
now it is believed the states of the Pope are wrested from
him, Rome and the suburban villages alone being retained for
him by the French army stationed at Rome. It is not believed
that an attempt will be made to take Rome or Venice, as that
would be encountering the two great military Continental
Powers, Austria and France. And it is supposed that the aim
of the King of Sardinia, in invading the states of the Church
and Naples, is to prevent the too ardent Garibaldi from fulfilling
his threat of no peace till the Quirinal and the palace of
the Doges be emancipated. However, all this you will see by
the papers herewith.</p>

<p>The China war is over. The combined forces advanced and
took Pekin. The emperor fled; but a treaty has been signed,
and a large sum as indemnity&mdash;though, I believe, not equal to
the outlay&mdash;is to be given to the European belligerents.</p>

<p>A Dutch ship is now here with an ambassador to make
a treaty.</p>

<p>At Bangkok we have had higher tides this season than there
have been for several years. The place continues healthy.</p>

<p>I forward you some calomel as requested. Calomel is a good
purgative, and it might be well occasionally to take one such
in preference to others; but castor oil is the safest where there
is any irritation of the bowels. In such cases it should alone be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
used; though, if you fancy there be derangement of the liver, it
would be well to use the mineral.</p>

<p>M. Malherbe has made up his mind to stay in Bangkok. As
soon as his successor comes out, he (M. M.) will live near Santa
Cruz, at the house owned by Mr. Hunter.</p>

<p>There is a chance of the second king going to Saraburi shortly
in a steamer; so, if I think newspapers would reach you before
the Chinaman, I may send you some, if a mail arrives by that
time. However, I shall not, you may depend upon it, forget to
attend to your wishes; but I really fear, after leaving Korat, it
will be difficult to send you letters. Even to Korat it will not
be easy; but though you did not tell me to send thither, I will
do so, if possible, within two or three months; after that date it
would be precarious, and I shall not do so. However, you can
often, by the governors, have an opportunity of writing to me;
and if you have altered any of your plans, or think of doing so,
let me know, so that I may forward news if an opportunity offers
for doing so.</p>

<p>The articles sent are: one large box from Mr. Adamson, one
small ditto from Malherbe, one ditto from England, one parcel
of papers from Mr. Swainson, one ditto from myself; three letters
(besides this one) are enclosed in the box from M. Malherbe,
which I will seal after enclosing this. The calomel is also in
the same box.</p>

<p>And now, wishing you a prosperous, pleasant journey, believe
me,</p>

<p class="sig">
Yours very sincerely,<br />

<span class="smcap">Jas. Campbell</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Remember, whenever you return, I shall expect you to
come direct to my house, and make it your own.</p>

<p class="dateline">
Battambong, 26th Nov. 1860.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear M. Mouhot</span>,</p>

<p>I had the honour of writing to you in September last;
did you receive my letter? As I did not know the courier, and
am ignorant whether his fidelity was to be depended upon, I do
not wish to lose a sure occasion which presents itself of recalling
myself to your remembrance.</p>

<p>It is now the end of the rainy season, and I think that you
must have returned from your expedition. I trust it has been
successful, and that you have not left your courage and good
health behind you on the banks of the Mekon or in the forests
of Laos.</p>

<p>I had promised to collect for you some “sinsei;” but the ants,
true Garibaldians, have annexed them during my journey to
Pinhalú, and all that I have been able to collect since are as
nothing compared to what the first rains brought with them.
Such as they are, I send them to you; they are few in number,
but for that you must blame the ants.</p>

<p>I have just had a visit from M. Miche and M. Arnoux. They
only remained a few days; and in spite of his wish to see Ongcor,
M. Arnoux was unable to go there.</p>

<p>They are raising troops here, preparing arms, and getting
ready to assist the Cambodians against the Annamites. The death
of the King of Cambodia will perhaps put an end to these fine
projects.</p>

<p>The mandarin who was sent by the King of Siam to carry
away the stones from Ongcor, and bring them to Bangkok, has
been assassinated in the “Pra Sat Ea proum,” and the mandarins
of Ongcor are accused of the murder; but they say that those of
Battambong had a hand in it. They have, therefore, all been
sent for to Bangkok for judgment, and among them the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
our late governor. You see we are not over tranquil here. The
war particularly terrifies my poor Battambongians.</p>

perhaps you may be there.</p>

<p>I have just received the two letters which you were kind
enough to write to me from Kong Khoc, containing enclosures
for MM. Arnoux and Silvestre. I much regretted not finding
you here, that I might have had the pleasure of seeing you once
more, and of conversing with you again before your departure
for Laos. I am glad to hear that you have been able to do
something at Khao-Khoc in spite of the advanced season.</p>

<p>I wish you much success in your new sphere of action. Do
you know that I sometimes envy you? Do not forget to procure
some skins of the argus pheasant; I think it differs from those
of the Malayan peninsula. Take great care of your health; and
if you are in want of anything which can be sent to you by way
of Korat, write to me for it.</p>

<p>The young man who will give you this is a Christian and an
associate of Cheek-Ke; he is a worthy lad, and you may trust
him with your collections, if you have been able to make any
in going through Don Phya Phia. All the Laotians declare
that in that forest there is a kind of orang-outang which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear M. Mouhot</span>,</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise and joy when, a week ago, a worthy
Chinese from Korat entered my house, bringing me your letter
of the 8th April. Blessed be God for granting you good health
and courage. With these you can go far, even to the source of
the Mekon; and if you return through Cambodia, with what
pleasure I shall see you again! But your letter is dated more
than eight months ago, and where are you now&mdash;I trust that
the rainy season induced you to descend the Menam instead of
the Mekon. Should you ever return to Battambong, you will
find something new there. A pretty little church now replaces
the old one; it is not yet quite finished, but I trust will be so
very shortly.</p>

<p>Since I last wrote to you, grave events have taken place in
Cambodia; the mandarins and people have risen against the
young king in favour of his brother. It has been less a revolt
than a universal pillage; nothing has been spared. Mgr.
Miche had great trouble to guard his house, with the help of a
young missionary and M. Aussoleil, for all the Christians fled.
For a fortnight he was subject to constant attacks, and more
than once saw sabres uplifted over his head; but his firmness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and bravery awed the mob, and he was lucky enough to preserve
his house.</p>

<p>Some damage was done to the Annamite church at the end of
the village. M. Miche wrote letter after letter to the French
commander in Cochin China, but his messengers were all murdered,
or else robbed, and their boats taken away from them.</p>

<p>At last, out of six letters, one reached its destination, and two
days after the French flag appeared in the rivers of Cambodia;
and at Pinhalú, six or seven cannon-shots spread terror among
the rebels for twenty-five leagues round.</p>

<p>The mandarins who had pillaged the village were fined, and
since then the Christians in Cambodia have been respected; and
a letter sealed by M. Miche is the best possible passport. All
this is well, you will say, and our countrymen did their duty.</p>

<p>You must excuse my lengthiness; at least, it will show that
you are not forgotten at Battambong, but that we preserve here
a happy remembrance of your too short stay. May you return in
a few months, and recruit after your fatigues.</p>

<p>I must conclude with offering you my good wishes on the new
year, and praying God to have you always and everywhere in his
holy keeping.</p>

please God, many pleasant days together yet, is the earnest wish
of your real friend,</p>

<h3 class="break">LETTERS ADDRESSED TO THE FAMILY
OF THE LATE M. MOUHOT. </h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">From Dr. Campbell to Madame Mouhot.</span></h4>

<p class="dateline">
Bangkok, April 7th, 1862.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Madame Mouhot</span>,</p>

<p>About three weeks ago I had the pleasure of forwarding a
letter from your husband, and I mentioned the probability of
a second one, written before the one sent, reaching me in time
for this mail. This has been realized, and I enclose the letter
referred to. News from Luang Prabang, up to the middle of
November, have also reached Bangkok, and oh! my dear madam,
what a sad duty devolves upon me in narrating certainties that
have transpired since my last communication. Would that I
had some relation in London to whom I could write and request
him to call upon you, to divulge the painful truth that your husband&mdash;my
valued friend&mdash;is, alas! now no more. It may perhaps
in a measure tend to soothe your sorrow under this severe
trial, to say that I never knew a person who was so universally
esteemed as he was by the foreign community of this city;
and that all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance deeply
regret his sudden and premature loss. The last letter he wrote
me was dated from Louang Prabang, on the 30th August; in it
he was satisfied with his success, and altogether buoyant in
spirits. He continued in the neighbourhood of the above-named
city, which is the capital of north-east Laos, till the middle of
October, when he returned to the city. On the 19th he has
written in his journal, “Attacked with fever;” but his servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and the Laos official account of his illness make it the 18th.
On the 29th he made an entry, but nothing subsequently, and
departed this life on Sunday the 10th November, at 7 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, being
twenty-eight days subsequent to the attack. His servants, after
seeing him interred, commenced their journey hither, taking with
them his baggage and everything he had collected. M. D’Istria,
the present French Consul, has to officiate as administrator to
the late M. Mouhot’s estate, but has assigned to me the care
of all your late husband’s manuscripts and collections. These
I thought of forwarding forthwith for Singapore, and thence, by
the kindness of Mr. Pady, to Europe; but as I expect to leave
for England on a short leave of absence by the middle of next
month, I think it better to retain them till then, and convey
them home myself.</p>

<p>On your late husband arriving here, he brought me a small
parcel from Dr. Norton Shaw, Secretary to the Royal Geographical
Society, Whitehall-place; and as it is only proper that
the Society should be made aware of this martyr to science, I
enclose two letters&mdash;the last he wrote me&mdash;for your perusal,
and that they may be handed to the above-named gentleman
for his information, forwarding, at the same time, the announcement
of M. Mouhot’s untimely death. On looking over the
charts he has left behind him, I find Louang Prabang placed 3°
to the north and about 1° to the east of that denoted in the map
given by Bishop Pallegoix; but as it would be improper to
write about his discoveries till you have received the documents,
and given them to some person for publication, I shall not
dilate further on that topic.</p>

<p>And now, my dear madam, I beg to tender you my sincere
condolence under the heavy bereavement which it has pleased
the Almighty to inflict upon you,</p>

<p class="sig">
And remain yours very sincerely,<br />

<h4><span class="smcap">From M. Ch. Fontaine, Missionary at Cochin
China, to M. Charles Mouhot.</span></h4>

<p class="dateline">
Foreign Missions, Paris, 128, Rue du Bac,<br />
15th August, 1862.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p>Permit me to give you this title; all the sentiments expressed
in your letter authorise it. What a worthy brother you
weep for! and I, what an honoured friend!</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of knowing M. H. Mouhot. I saw him
first at Bangkok, and six or eight months after at Pinhalú, in
Cambodia, where he remained with us ten days, sharing with us
our house and our table, which is always open to any worthy
fellow-countryman whom chance may lead to those parts. In
both places all our brotherhood were charmed to make the
acquaintance of so devoted a scion of learning, so polished a
Frenchman, and so exemplary a Christian. All these qualities
rendered him dear to the whole of the missionaries who had
the pleasure of his acquaintance; and it was a real happiness
to us to render him any little service possible in the performance
of the troublesome task which he had imposed upon himself,
of exploring countries so wild and destitute of comfort.</p>

<p>On his return from among the Stiêns, where he met MM.
Guilloux and Arnoux, this dear friend lavished on me the
greatest care, and expended for me all his medical science; for
I had then been several months suffering from the malady
which afterwards obliged me to return to France to recruit.</p>

<p>He left us to go to Battambong to M. Silvestre, and at the
parting we experienced the deepest regret at losing the society
of a friend who had so much cheered our solitude. From Battambong
he was to return to Siam, and thence to Birmah, Bengal,
and Europe. I wrote to him several times, both from Bangkok,
from Pinhalú, and from Singapore, where my illness had induced
me to go to consult an English physician; but M. Mouhot had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
changed his plans; he wished to explore Laos, a country whose
climate is always so fatal to foreigners. There God saw fit to
summon him to a better world. This I read with great sorrow
in a Parisian newspaper; it was an extract from a London
journal.</p>

<p>When I was abroad I heard of the death of my father, then
of that of my mother, and I declare that these two announcements
did not make more impression upon me than did the
news of the death of a man whose equal I had not met with for
twenty years; and the thought of his death, without any help
but that of his servants during his illness and in his last moments,
was more than enough to bring tears to my eyes as I
remembered this good and benevolent friend. Be assured, dear
Sir, that my feelings are shared by all the brothers who knew
him. The natives themselves must have felt regret at his
death; for all who knew him had only praises to repeat of his
conduct towards them; and all acknowledged his gentleness and
generosity&mdash;both qualities invaluable in the eyes of those people.</p>

<p>Permit me, then, dear Sir, to unite my regrets to your grief,
and to present my respects to Madame Mouhot, together with
my warmest sympathy with her in her affliction; also with your
father and your wife. Receive my thanks for your having
honoured me with your friendship; and be assured of my desire
to be useful to you if ever it should lie in my power.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Twelve of us are about to set out for Indo-China, and
I will not fail to express to Mgr. Miche and his companions the
kind feelings which you express with regard to them. On the
20th we shall sail from Marseilles in the <i>Hydaspe</i>. Write to
the Seminary of Foreign Missions, whence our correspondence
will be forwarded to us. My family live at Laval, and you will

<h4><span class="smcap">From Mr. Samuel Stevens to M. Charles Mouhot.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Stevens</span> has the honour to inform M. C. Mouhot that
the collection made by his late brother in the mountains of Laos is
very fine, particularly the insects and shells. Among the former
are a great number of beautiful and new species, one of which,
a splendid Carabus, has been described in the ‘Zoological
Review’ at Paris, under the name of Mouhotia gloriosa, in compliment
to the late lamented M. Mouhot. This name is very
appropriate, as it is one of the most beautiful and remarkable
beetles which has been seen for years. There is also a beautiful
set of Longicorns, and other insects of the order of Coleoptera,
of which a great number are new to science.</p>

<p>The land and fresh-water shells are also very beautiful.
Among the former there are twenty-five different genera; eight
or ten are quite new, and some of them very remarkable. They
will shortly be described by Dr. Pfeiffer and others.</p>

<p>I can truly say that the insects and shells equal, if they do
not surpass, the most beautiful collections I have ever received;
and clearly demonstrate how rich a country for the naturalist
lies between Siam and Cochin China.</p>

<p>There is also a small collection of birds and some monkeys,
small animals, reptiles, and serpents in spirits, of which some
are quite new.</p>

<p>The collection of insects and shells made in Cambodia was
also very beautiful, and contained the large and fine <i>Helix Cambojiensis</i>,
one of the best and most beautiful specimens known;
also, the <i>Bulimus Cambojiensis</i>, and a splendid <i>Buprestida</i>, new
and unique, besides a great number of others, new to science.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p class="dateline">
Bangkok, Nov. 1862.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>On my return from Java a few days ago, I found waiting
for me your kind letter, for which I thank you, although I
should have wished to make your acquaintance under happier
circumstances. All consolation from me, I know, would be
ineffectual. The friendship I felt for your brother was not
that of a stranger, but rather as though he were a member of
my family; and I felt most painfully the news which met me
on my return, of his death so far away: for I had been pleasing
myself with the idea of his return, and long before my arrival
here had given orders for his reception, and that he should be
welcomed as though I were present.</p>

<p>One great consolation to the survivors is the feeling of how
much he is regretted; here he had not a single enemy, but
every one spoke of him as the best of men. I vainly tried to
dissuade him from undertaking this dangerous expedition, for
I had already lost a dear friend in that country. He was
treacherously assassinated there by his boatmen.</p>

<p>I am much pleased with the frank manner in which you offer
me your friendship. I thank you, and accept it with all my
heart.</p>

<h3 class="break">PAPER READ AT
THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY, </h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">10th March</span>, 1862.</p>

<p class="center">LORD ASHBURTON, <span class="smcap">President</span>.</p>


<p>M. Mouhot traversed Cambodia from east to west, and
also ascended the Mekon river to the frontier of Laos. He
returned to the coast by crossing the water-parting between
it and the basin of the Menam river, and descending to
Bangkok.</p>

<p>The Mekon is a vast melancholy-looking river, three miles
broad, covered with islands, and flowing with the rapidity of a
torrent. Its shores are covered with aquatic birds, but its
waters are almost deserted by canoes.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> A plain covered with
coarse herbage separates it from the forest by which Cambodia
is overspread, and which can rarely be traversed except by
cutting a way. That forest is exceedingly unhealthy.</p>

<p>M. Mouhot reached Brelum, a village in lat. 11° 58′, long.
107° 12′, inhabited by a secluded race of wild people, whose
customs are minutely described, differing in features from the
Cambodian and Laos tribes, and forming one of a series of
similar groups widely distributed in the less accessible parts
of Cochin China, Cambodia, and Burmah. They are believed
by M. Mouhot to be the aborigines of the land. Two Catholic
missionaries were resident at Brelum.</p>

<p>Subsequently the author visited the large Buddhist ruins of
Ongcor, of which he has brought back numerous sketches. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
speaks of the mineral wealth of Cambodia&mdash;its iron, gold, lead,
and copper. In the islands of Phu-Quoc or Koh Tron, belonging
to Cochin China and near to Komput, there are rich
mines of coal, similar to our Cannel coal, from which ornaments
are made. Several extinct volcanoes exist in Pechaburi, of
heights not exceeding 2000 feet above the sea-level, and there
are two active ones in an island called Ko-man, lat. 12° 30′,
long. 101° 50′, in the Gulf of Siam.</p>

<p>Dr. Hodgkin stated that, besides the two letters, portions of
which had been read, and the drawings and charts, M. Mouhot
had likewise sent an elaborate description of the ruins which he
found at Ongcor and in its vicinity. The plans on the table
would give some idea of the magnitude of these ruins. A great
part of the manuscript which accompanied them described their
structure and workmanship. They were constructed chiefly of
granite, and many of the stones were not only of very large size,
but were elaborately carved. The workmanship of some of
them was described as exquisite, and the designs not so deficient
in artistic taste as one might suppose. Many of them represented
imaginary animals, such as serpents with many heads;
others, beasts of burden&mdash;horses, elephants, and bullocks. These
temples were situated in a district which was now completely
imbedded in a forest very difficult of access, and were so much
in ruins that trees were growing on the roofs, and many of the
galleries were in a state of great decay. The base and a large
portion of the elevation were constructed of a ferruginous rock,
but for the upper part blocks of granite were used&mdash;so exquisitely
cut as to require no mortar to fill the interstices, and
carved with relievos relating to mythological subjects indicative
of Buddhism. M. Mouhot had copied some of the inscriptions,
which from their antiquity the natives who accompanied him
were unable to read. The characters so nearly resembled the
Siamese that Dr. H. had no doubt that a skilful archæologist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
would have very little difficulty in deciphering them. He believed
that the remains in question would be found equal in
value to those which had recently been explored in Central
America; and he felt convinced that when the descriptions
were published, M. Mouhot would be thought deserving of great
respect.</p>

<p>Mr. Crawfurd said it was about forty years since he visited
the country, but his recollection of it continued vivid to this
day. Most people knew very little about Cambodia; its very
name was only familiar to us in that of its product, gamboge,
which word was nothing else than a corruption of Cambodia.
It was one of five or six states lying between India and China,
whose inhabitants had lived under a second or third-rate civilisation
at all times&mdash;never equal, whether physically, morally,
or intellectually, to the Chinese, or even the Hindoos. At the
present time Cambodia was a poor little state, having been
encroached upon by the Siamese to the north, and by Cochin
China to the south. M. Mouhot had given us an account of a
country that no European had ever visited before. With respect
to that gentleman’s belief that certain wild tribes whom he
described had descended from Thibet, he (Mr. Crawfurd) believed
that his ethnology was at fault. For his part, he believed
these wild people to be no other than natives of the country&mdash;mere
mountaineers, who had escaped from the bondage, and
hence from the civilisation, of the plain. Such people existed in
Hindoostan, in Siam, in the Burmese empire, in Cochin China,
and in China itself&mdash;in fact, they were of no distinct origin, but
simply the natives in a rude, savage, uncivilised state.</p>

<p>With respect to the French, he did not know on what grounds
they had gone to Cambodia. They had obtained possession of
one spot which was eminently fitted for a settlement. The
finest river in all India, as far as European shipping was concerned,
was the river at Saigon, which he had himself ascended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
about 14 miles, and found it navigable even for an old “seventy-four.”
He believed it was the intention of the French to
attempt the conquest of the whole of Cochin China. If they
effected it, and occupied it, they would find it a monstrous difficulty.
It would prove another Algeria, with the additional disadvantage
of being 15,000 miles off instead of 500, and within
the torrid instead of the temperate zone. The climate was very
hot, the country was covered with forests, the malaria and the
heat rendered it unsuitable for the European constitution. If
they made an advance upon the Cochin Chinese capital, they
would find the enterprise one of great difficulty. From Saigon
to the northern confines of Cochin China the distance is 1500
miles, and the capital itself could not be less than 700 or 800
miles from Saigon, situated on a small river navigable only for
large boats, with a narrow mouth, and two considerable fortresses,
one on each side, at its mouth. When they arrived,
they would find one of the largest and most regular fortifications
in the East. He believed it was the most regular, after Fort
William in Bengal, and a great deal larger than Fort William.
It was constructed by the French, and now they will have considerable
difficulty in conquering their own work. The French
had a perfect right to be in Cochin China, and their being
there would do no harm, but rather good, however questionable
the benefit to themselves; for their presence amounted to the
substitution of a friendly and civilised power for a rude and
inhospitable one.</p>

<p>The drawings on the table were exceedingly curious and
interesting; they were admirably done, and exhibited representations
of some remarkable monuments, evidently of Buddhist
origin. They reminded him very much, though inferior in
quality and beauty, of the monuments of the island of Java.
He never heard of volcanoes when he was in Cambodia, but he
had no doubt M. Mouhot’s information was correct, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
it appeared he did not describe them from his own personal
experience. He would add a word upon the alphabets which
were on the table. The Cambodians had invented a written
phonetic character, which they used at the present time; therefore
there could be no difficulty in understanding a Cambodian
manuscript. But there were several of those now exhibited
which were of more or less antiquity. One of them seemed to
be the alphabet which was used by the Cambodians in their
religious rites. The figure of Buddha showed that the Cambodians
were worshippers of Buddha.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LETTER TO M. CHARLES MOUHOT.</div>

<p>The members of the “Société d’Émulation” at Montbéliard
desire to express the deep regret which they have experienced
at the premature death of their fellow-townsman
M. Henri Mouhot. After a three years’ journey in Cambodia
and Siam, during which he devoted himself to researches which
have been highly appreciated by the Geographical and Zoological
Societies of London, he fell a victim at the early age of thirty-five
to his love of science. His work remained unfinished, but
it was gloriously commenced, and his name will not perish.
The regret experienced by his friends is the greater from their
conviction that had he lived he would have been still more an
honour to his native town, and that the name of Mouhot would
have ranked side by side with those illustrious ones which have
already rendered Montbéliard famous in the department of
Natural Science.</p>
